I explained we needed 4 burgers and 4 fries again, no apologies for their own confusion and mistakes. Lady 2 just says the whole order needs to be cancelled and redone, again no apologies, didn't even offer to help further, just stayed in the kitchen.

Reason being, this isn't their first restaurant opening. Globe has two other locations, so it's owners should be able to avoid the rookie mistakes of opening a restaurant. But rather than focus on the facts that it smelled like a construction site, the floors and walls needed some minor finishing work, the staff were wandering about looking slightly confused and a little scared, and the place generally seemed like it probably wasn't ready to open just yet, I'm going to put all that aside and focus on the rest of Globe.\n\nGlobe's focus is on local stuff; that means they try to only serve products that are made close-to-home. Trouble is, I'm not exactly sure how far that close-to-home boundary extends to. I was told that it includes Ontario as a whole, but it could also go much further East or West; their Albacore tuna, for example, comes from BC and their mussels come from PEI. Other items don't explicitly explain where they come from, like the Cornish hen. That's the difficulty with going local though; right-off-the-bat you need to firmly establish your local boundaries. BC and PEI, after all, aren't right around the corner. Why not Maine lobster? Maine is a lot closer and seems a lot more local to me than anywhere in BC.\n\nI suppose my beef here is that if you want to focus on locally produced stuff, then why not do it right down to the last detail? Why have a couple of wines from Italy and the US when you could easily make a wine menu completely from Niagara Peninsula wines or even from West Coast British Columbia (since we haven't yet established where that local line is drawn). I suppose the entire local concept is pretty hot right now, considering the whole farm-to-table trend, but those places are a bit more sincere by growing and sourcing everything onsite. To me, that's what true local eating is all about: setting firm boundaries.\n\nThe main thing that caught me right away-even more so than the local-ness of stuff-was the truly reasonable prices. At my initial walk-in to the beautiful dining room, I expected to pay a bit more, but that wasn't the case at all. Starters are around 11 bucks, entrees are around 22; at prices like that, it's even kind of refreshing, considering how elegant both the dining room and bar spaces are. And the food is good too. The local carnivore flatbread, for example, had a perfectly cooked flatbread base with some delicious, good-quality meats. The baked Spring vegetable tart seemed a little strange served on raw spinach, but the contrast worked nicely together.\n\nThe dining room space is beautiful. 20 foot ceilings, elegant lighting, solid wooden tables. In terms of sheer ambience and sophistication, there's nothing in Bloor West Village that can even come close to competing with Globe.\n\nDespite the wandering servers, we were lucky enough to have the only one that seemed focused. Even though the meddling manager kept needlessly hovering over us mere seconds each time before our server got there, we had fantastic service that pretty much made the entire experience better. If we had another server, I probably would have thought a lot less.\n\nTruth be told, Globe's focus on local products seems to be more of a gimmick at this point rather than a passion. However despite that, it was a pretty good overall experience, opening jitters and stage fright aside. I think that once they work all the kinks out, there'll be nothing in Bloor West Village-an area that is really hurting for some good restaurants to begin with-that can even come close to competing with Globe.","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":1}

I dug the concept: tapas with a twist. This is definitely not your traditional, Spanish tapas. At Origin, you'll sample small plates with Asian, Italian and Latin influences. I didn't find the menu overwhelming, but our server was more than happy to help steer the meal so that similar and complimentary flavours were eaten together.\n\nIt was tough to narrow it down, as we would have been happy with just about anything on the menu. We started with the tostones: smashed, flattened and deep-fried plantains with guacamole on the side. The plantains were very well seasoned, with generous use of kosher salt and a light dusting of curry powder.\n\nNext up were the deviled eggs with smoked bacon and gremolata and the smoked cod croquettes with saffron aioli. Both were a big hit at the table, disappearing in a flash. I preferred the croquettes of the two, but I didn't exactly NOT eat my share of the deviled eggs either.\n\nThose scrumptious bites devoured, we ordered another bottle of wine (three cheers for Monday night dinners with lots of wine!) and anticipated the arrival of more delectable plates. While we waited, we marveled at the strangeness of the cutlery provided. The only way to balance your knife was blade up. That seemed...dangerous. Especially after the third glass of cabernet sauvignon.\n\nOur next dish appeared and we dove right back in (carefully, so as not to cut ourselves on our upturned knives). A gorgeously-presented order from the Mozzarella Bar: bufala mozzarella with pear, rosemary oil, pine nuts that was drizzled with honey and placed on a crunchy, toasted slice of calabrese bread.\n\nNext up was the Bangkok beef salad with peanuts, mint, mango, fried shallots and a sweet and sour dressing. There was a moment of hesitation while we all tried to dance around the fact that splitting this thing among the three of us might get violent. In the end however, we shared well (our kindergarten teachers would be so proud!). This wasn't an exceptionally complicated dish, but it was done to perfection: the beef was tender and pink; the mangoes were ripe and slippery; the shallots and peanuts added the crunch the dish needed; and the cilantro added the wonderful, bright note at the end. It should be noted that my friend said it was the third time she'd had this particular dish, and it was exactly the same every time. THAT is a sign of a great restaurant.\n\nOur final round of food was to arrive, and we were practically giddy with excitement. We had decided on the Chinois duck with pickled cucumber, hoisin and sriracha sauce on a chive pancake, the curried shrimp with naan and the miso-glazed black cod with soba noodles and a ginger vinaigrette. We knew each dish would be good, but didn't know HOW good. We had spent the first half of the meal happily eating away and we were by no means disappointed with our choices. But these last three dishes absolutely blew them all out of the water. The duck was crispy and, I must say, substantial. The kitchen does not scrimp on the portions at all with this dish! The sweet hoisin sauce was a great compliment to the duck and the heat of the sriracha. A definite must-order at Origin.\n\nNext up, we attacked the curried shrimp, which was intensely flavoured and perfectly spicy. The soft, aromatic naan bread sopped up the spicy broth that was left after devouring the plump, juicy shrimp. Another dish that hit its mark!\n\nFinally (and kind of sadly), we came to our last dish: the black cod. Black cod is one my favourite fish and I have it a fair bit. When I was out in Vancouver earlier this year, I had it almost once a day. but this black cod might be the best I've had...ever. It was flaky, tender and moist. The miso glaze was pleasantly salty and the skin, most importantly, was nice and crispy. The soba noodles were served with the ginger vinaigrette and by the time we were done, there was literally nothing left on the plate. In all likelihood, the best dish of the night though the three of us never could decide on a clear winner in that category.\n\nAll in all, I would definitely recommend Origin to anyone who has some reasonably adventurous taste buds and who is willing to share. There is one composed plate that makes a meal - a burger combo with Spanish fries and a float. I have no doubt it's delicious, but it seems kind of beside the point of a restaurant like this. Go with friends, go on a date, go with family. It's not a cheap night out, but it is most definitely money well spent.","useful":4,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Or, in this case, a bar by its' signage. Let's face it, I'm a sucker for good signage. And Souz Dal has it. The rusty globe hangs outside like a relic, the name of the bar cut into the side. Lit, and glowingfrom within, it reminds me of one of those tin punch-out crafts made from a (insert random legume) canat summer camp. But much cooler of course. It was this sign that caught my attention on more than one occasion, beckoning me in when I had somewhere else to be. Finally, one night a couple of weeks ago, I gave in to its sirens call. I was a little bit disappointed.\n\nIt was devoid of people save for us and the lonely bartender. I say lonely, butjudging by his charm (see: none) he probably liked it better thatway. Granted though, it was early - Souz Dal only has a drink menu - and a few more folk trickled in as the night wore on.\n\nThe stars I gave are attributed solelyto the bar's ambience. Dimly lit, and painted in muted reds and oranges it has an earthy orMoorish feel to it. Worn textiles and cathedral mirrors adorn the walls, while candles flicker on every table, casting shadows. The back patio has a similar vibe happening, cloistered in by high walls, andlit by candles wedged in the mouths of old wine bottles.\n\nNow I rarely turn down a good patio, but in this case I chose aseat inside, which says a lot.Reclined on velvet benches at our table by the open front window, we watched College Street come alive as we perused the drink menu. I was in a cocktail mood, and my friend had read somewhere that Souz Dal claimed to have the \"best\" mojitos in the city, so that was the first order I placed. \n\nNow I've been to Cuba. I did a little backpacking, starting in Havanaand makingmy way to the South coast. I wouldn't say I'm a connoiseur of the mojito because of this, but I diddrink my fair share, and like to think I know a thing or two about a good one. And this wasn't one of them. There wasn't nearly enough mint or sugar, so it was overwhelmingly bitter. I don't like my mojitos to taste like Kool-Aid, but I do like a little sweetness to curb the edge. \n\nUnlikely to order another of the same, but unwilling to give up on the bar, we tried a few other beverages. Nothing wowed us. The Moscow Mule with its ginger beer offered a nice slow burn, but it also wasn't a repeat offender. The fortune cookie garnish on the lychee-infused Soho martini was fun, but not nearly as tasty as a lychee would have been. \n\nAlthough funky signage and ambience mean a lot to me, a good drink means even more, so chancesare Iwon't be returning to Souz Dal. If however, you are in the market for an intimate date setting (see: empty bar) then head on over. And if a mediocre mojito is your thing, then you can get them herefor $5.75 on Mondays.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

On a relatively quiet stretch of Bloor West, between Dovercourt and Dufferin, sits Mazz Sushi.\n\nAn unassuming neighbourhood favourite for years, Mazz Sushi has been one of the few sushi options for Bloorcourt and Bloordale residents. Each time I visit, I am amazed by how bustling a place it is with the constant turning of tables and the rapid fire filling of take-out bags.\n\nOn a recent weeknight excursion, the small dining room was full, with a great mix of students, parents with young children and older couples; a typical audience for Mazz. Soon the servers were trying to accommodate extra guests and pointing out that it would be a '10 to 15 minute wait' for a table.\n\nSeated, with menus in hand, the server soon appeared with the tea that was barely just ordered. Mazz's tea is very earthy in flavour with a hint of barley. Moving on quickly to another table, he left us to continue to ponder the menus, not returning for quite some time.\n\nUpon his return, we quickly placed our order for various maki and sashimi hoping that the busyness of the place wouldn't slow the normally lightning-quick service.\n\nAfter a moment, he returned with a bowl of congee and an amuse-bouche of marinated tofu. Don't be alarmed, these are Mazz's welcome dishes. I find the tofu pleasant enough, but the congee seems a little too heavy and porridge-like to start a meal.\n\nBefore these two were done, he was back again with the ubiquitous Miso soup and house salad. The soup was seasoned and flavourful with lots of nori and tofu. The salad was a small mixture of iceberg lettuce with some vegetable shavings and slices: by the book, but not out of this world.\n\nJust as we were finishing our appetizers, the first of our rolls arrived. We ordered a Spicy Tuna maki: tuna mixed with crumbled tempura and hot sauce. My guest, not a fan of spicy food, likes Mazz's version, as she doesn't normally find it too spicy. Unfortunately this time they were a little too spicy for her. Good for me, but bad for her. A minor thing, but consistency means repeat business.\n\nNext, the rest of our food arrived: a sashimi dinner and Dynamite roll. The sashimi dinner is always a joy at Mazz, and this time was no different. The plate usually contains a nice selection of tuna, white tuna, salmon and possibly mackerel, and always has more pieces then advertised. This time was no different, and the fish was very fresh. The only complaint, and I've found this happens quite regularly in Toronto, is that the white tuna was served too cold. The Dynamite roll was large, but a little tasteless; seemingly prepared in too much of a hurry, a couple of pieces unraveled and fell apart on the plate.\n\nOverall, Mazz Sushi let us down a little on this visit. The staff seemed rushed and unable to provide the consistency that we have come to expect. Not once during our meal were we offered more tea, a slight unheard-of in a sushi restaurant. The food, although served quickly, wasn't up to their usual standards, and the wait to order was long. And although it remains quite inexpensive, the discount on the receipt for paying with cash seems to have disappeared with the updating of cash register system.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":1}

Sure, I know the breakfast is only 3 dollars, so I probably shouldn't be hard on it; but regardless of price, I'd still like my meal to be served hot and be put together with some level of care and attention.\n\nThis is a pretty mediocre breakfast here: a slice of warm ham, a strip of old bacon, browned toast, over\/undercooked eggs, leftover potatoes, breakfast served here is less-than-spectacular, and the service staff doesn't seem to care if you complain about it; I'm sure they've heard it all countless times before.\n\nAll of this, of course, is served in one Toronto's prized possessions, High Park. If it wasn't for the location, I certainly would have given them 1 star. In fact, it wasn't for the location, I probably wouldn't have eaten there at all.

Uncle Betty's has only been open for a few months, but it already seems to have garnered a dedicated following. We went to Uncle Betty's on a bustling Friday night, looking for a casual meal and easy going atmosphere; Uncle Betty's certainly provided both. Painted in bright blue and cheery orange, lots of seating inside, and a small patio off the front, we felt right at home. Several families were enjoying meals with their kids in tow As the evening wore on though, most of those families were replaced with twenty and thirty-somethings looking for a cool place to hang out.\n\nOffering sandwiches, burgers, hot dogs, salads, and many other of Uncle Betty's specialty creations, the menu is fairly extensive and varied. We ordered the roasted vegetable sandwich with a salad, and the grilled cheese sandwich, which was made with homemade mac-and-cheese and meatloaf stuffed inside. Their grilled cheese also comes in a pulled pork variety, which I am sure we will try on our next outing. Both meals were great, the vegetable sandwich was warm, the cheese was nicely melted, and the bread was crisp. The grilled cheeses sandwich was deemed as one of the \"best ever,\" however, the portion size was on the small side for a $15 sandwich. Both of us agreed that the sandwich could be a little bigger, but overall we were impressed with the quality and creative effort put into the food. \n\nFor dessert, we each tried a Dreesen's cinnamon sugar doughnut, made fresh on site, and although they were pretty tasty, I am setting my sights on the ice cream bar next time. It is far too bright and colourful to miss, with jars of candy toppings and a great selection of ice cream flavours to choose from.\n\nThe service was friendly and attentive, and we had a conversation with the owner, Samara Melanson, as we were leaving. Samara and her husband recently opened the restaurant, and it's always great to meet the owner while dining out and learn about the creation of the restaurant and where some of the ideas for the food come from. She told us that chef Paul Lampa was brought over from Coquine restaurant, which explains the \"gourmet\" comfort food bent and the locally sourced ingredients. \n\nMost appetizers are priced from 6 - 10 dollars; entrees varied in price from about 9 - 15 dollars, and wine and beer was in the 6 - 8 range. And Uncle Betty's carries Kicking Horse coffee, which is an instant sell and a welcome find for this Toronto-transplanted Western girl. \n\nBetty's also offers what looks to be a delicious weekend brunch, with homestyle blueberry pancake and Uncle Betty's own take on eggs benny, which comes served on a doughnut.  We will definitely be back to Uncle Betty's to try some of the other great entrees on the menu, and  of course to dig into their ice cream bar.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":2}

A friend used to live there many moons ago, but we spent most of our time drinking red wine on her porch until the wee hours in the morning instead of exploring what the neighbourhood had to offer. In recent years, however, the lure of the restaurants lining Roncesvalles Ave has drawn me to the West side of the city more frequently. I never know quite what to expect when I arrive, but I am always pleasantly surprised.\n\nOne such surprise awaited me at The Ace. I had heard that the space had been standing empty for ages; even that it had once been a Chinese restaurant. Now headed up by chef Peter McKnight, it has been reopened as a place to stop in for some classic comfort food: fried chicken, burgers, soup, Shepherd's pie. While the menu has changed, the décor most certainly did not; the new owners have kept as much of the original decoration as possible giving the place an authentic 1950's feel.\nMy friend and I settled in for our meal in a booth near the back of across from the open kitchen. When asked what we'd like to drink, I tried to sneak a peek at the taps available only to find that there were none in sight. Well, no taps that I recognized anyway. Our waiter informed us that the fantastic milkshake mixer sitting on the counter served as the taps.  A great aesthetic touch behind the bar.\n\nWe submitted our drink orders - Mill St. for me, the Ace Manhattan for my friend - and took stock of the menu.  Written out on paper were five or six appetizers and five or six mains from which to choose. We pondered several options, but when the waiter announced that one of the specials of the day was a \"Christmas burger\" the whole plan changed. Ground turkey with stuffing in the middle, topped with cranberry chutney? THIS had to be eaten. As delicious as it sounded, it was actually better than anticipated.  It hit all the parts of your palate and it was gobbled up in minutes. \n\nAlso sampled were the deep-fried Brussels sprouts with dill aioli and the gorgeous, briny oysters. Both were truly excellent and personified what The Ace is all about: simple food done perfectly. My dining companion and I nearly stabbed each other with our forks trying to get at the Brussels sprouts, something I truly thought would never, ever happen in my lifetime. \n\nIf you're at The Ace, do not miss the fried chicken, which is succulent, juicy and crispy, served with him gravy, collard greens and cornbread (though why the cornbread is served on the gravy is a bit beyond me, as it has the unfortunate effect of making the bread a big soggy after a while). The fresh pasta with tuna, chiles, plum tomatoes and basil was cooked to exactly al dente and the flaked trout with potatoes, radishes and red onions struck a great balance of temperature, texture and flavor. \nNo matter how full you may be from the well-sized  portions, I implore you not to skip dessert. The ice cream in particular is outstanding. Do not miss the oatmeal, stout or chocolate-rosemary concoctions: they are all made in-house and I am not ashamed to admit that I asked for an entire vat of the chocolate-rosemary ice cream to take home so that I could swim in it. Seriously. Do not miss dessert!\n\nBy the time we left around 8pm, The Ace had a line up of hungry patrons eager to relax in a comfortable, homey environment with excellent comfort food, attentive staff and a great bartender. I would suggest dressing in layers as it gets quite warm, as evidenced by the perpetually fogged-over front window.  Go early or go late or go for brunch. You won't be disappointed.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":1}

Not anymore...\n\nA former Burger King at Bathurst and Bloor has become the second Toronto location for the Vancouver dynamo chain. It's easy enough to almost walk past Guu Sakabar--nicknamed Guu 2--as you travel down Bloor Street; the exterior is dark and the signage is minimal, as are the windows. Once you do see it though, the slate-coloured walls and wood accents look stunning and attractive.\n\nInside, things are kept just as simple and uncluttered with a very open concept dining room filled with long wooden tables. Unlike the Church Street location, this Guu has a small separate dining space where patrons are expected to de-shoe before being seated on the floor. Actually, you won't find a typical table anywhere at Guu Sakabar. In the main dining room, the idea is that you share your experience with others at large communal tables--with your friends, or with strangers. If you're uncomfortable with these seating arrangements you can sit at the bar, but fair warning you will be right in the thick of things...\n\nThis restaurant is famous for a quirky element that is unavoidable during your dining experience; from the time you enter to the time you leave you'll be subject to loud yells and cheers from the staff that boom through the whole restaurant. They boisterously welcome you when you enter, and give you a loud farewell when you leave. I would assume there are a handful of people out there who would be infinitely turned off by this, but I think it gives this place one of the best atmospheres around. I almost expected the Happy Birthday chant to be low-key as an ironic contrast, but they don't miss a beat. The entire staff literally sings a birthday song to you, even the chefs behind the counter.\n\nWith that in mind, this has to be one of the most well-trained service and kitchen staff I've ever come across. I went to Guu 2 on a Tuesday evening, and it was jam-packed. Between seating guests, taking orders, delivering orders, cooking, clearing and processing payments, I have no idea how they manage to keep on top of their enthusiastic cheers. Guu has raised the bar for what I believe a well-working service staff is capable of. I will say that a couple of our orders that I consider starters, like salads and sashimi, came out last, but the dishes are small, and if you order a few and they come out of the kitchen so fast that the sequence hardly matters. The organization and teamwork is impeccable; we sat at the bar in front of all the action and more than once, a dish would be ready to go out and the chefs would hand them right to us. It seems like everyone knows where everything goes and what everyone is doing. Awesome.\n\nWell to me, a restaurant is worth nothing if the food doesn't hold up, so I am happy to say that the food on this Japanese Tapas-style menu does have a strong voice, even in this noisy dining room.\n\nA variety of dishes are offered, from the expected edamame and sashimi to the more unique items like puffed octopus (a soufflé of tender octopus and creamy cheese) and fried skewers of quail egg. Each item's price point is around what I expect from a Tapas restaurant, but the servings are very substantial. The sashimi salad ($7.80) in particular is large enough to be split amongst two people heartily, or four people with ease. The sashimi pieces are definitely worthy of two bites each and you can get six in a platter for only $6.80.\n\nOne benefit to sitting at the bar is watching each dish go out. One by one we found ourselves ogling at what was going past.\n\nQuite simply, the food is great, and you certainly get more than what you pay for. It was just a fun dining experience to be a part of; and I did feel as though we were part of it. You may have to yell your conversations across the table to be heard, but at the same time, you'll be smiling while doing it.","useful":5,"funny":0,"cool":3}

Every couple of years some new ingredient or dish seems to capture the attention of cooks everywhere. Someone does it well, and then soon niche restaurants seem to be popping up everywhere.\n\nA number of years ago, it was the burrito, soon the poutine became chic.\nLately it seems like everyone needs to prove they have the best Southern-style barbeque.\n\nOn a recent Saturday night, I had the opportunity to eat at Lou Dawg's; Southern Sandwiches at King and Portland in the Entertainment District. Nestled in the basement, Lou Dawg's seems to be punching above its weight. It has a fairly small front of house, and on this night, a third of that front of house seemed to be taken up by an impromptu stage while the sound and light guys were setting up. And once they did, it was loud! Not only that, it wasn't even music. The sound system was blaring an audio feed from the football game projected on the large screen on the opposite wall. Despite that, the place was buzzing. Pretty much all the tables were full and the young-ish crowd that was there seemed to be happy enough, with tables full of plates and pints.\n\nWith our large order placed at the bar, we watched a group clear out and quickly snagged the table. No sooner did he drop off our pints did our food arrive. It was super quick, and it couldn't have been more than five minutes. My guests and I ordered the gamut of the menu: pulled chicken, beef brisket, and pulled pork sandwiches with potato salad, coleslaw and a 'Loutine' (poutine with pulled pork). Everything looked great...\n\nThe pulled pork had a pleasant smoky flavour and was quite juicy and moist, but after a couple of bites it seemed to be very one note; there wasn't that nice tang you get with true southern barbeque. The pulled chicken was very dry. This is a dish most people have difficulty doing well, and I don't think Lou Dawg's is any different. It seemed like it had been sitting around for awhile... waiting for someone to order it... The beef brisket was popping with flavour. It was succulent, with just the right amount of fattiness. If you're there, I highly recommend it.\n\nSide dishes is where Lou Dawg's really shines. Their coleslaw is creamy, sweet and crisp, with dried cranberries and raisins. And the potato salad? Truly made with love. It burst with flavours of dill and mustard seed, and the potatoes were cooked to the perfect texture.\n\nThe small poutine was quite a large portion. The fries were as they should be: crisp and fresh tasting with a hefty salting. If the cheese was curds, you couldn't tell. They had lost all of their consistency from over heating. The chicken gravy was way too salty and overpowered the mild flavour on the pulled pork.\n\nOverall, Lou Dawg's didn't live up to the hype. I've had better Southern barbeque at places that don't specialize in it, and way better at places that do. Coupled with that, the restaurant seemed a little unsure of itself. Is it trying to be a restaurant? a sports bar? or a neighbourhood performance space? or just a hangout for friends of the staff? This indecision usually sounds the death knell of any place. So while the sides and brisket made it a place worth returning to, there wasn't much keeping me from going somewhere else.","useful":8,"funny":0,"cool":1}

Well, it was until The Mugshot Tavern opened anyways... The Mugshot easily provides the perfect answer to filling that void, and then some. Truly nice owners, delicious food, and a killer environment, this place takes the neighbourhood bar way beyond what it's expected to be.\n\nIf the Mugshot doesn't have the best draft selection in a 10 km radius, it certainly has the most well-thought-out one. These guys obviously love beer, and more obviously is that they've put a ton of thought into what is being pulled from the taps. It's all craft beer, and some interesting stuff at that. Chances are they have a few you've never even heard of, like the King Pilsner and Warthog Ale. It wouldn't be a stretch to say that they're probably one of only a handful of places in the city with either on tap. Don't expect to find Canadian or Blue here; what they offer is much more creative than any of that stuff.\n\nThe food, and the entire menu for that matter, is equally well-thought out. It's a killer mix of Southern-soul and comfort food, and they do a dam fine job of pulling it off. You can expect to find Southern favorites, like fried chicken with fritters, and some not so expected ones, like in-house-made corn dogs with chutney. The presentation is pretty decent too and again, goes beyond the typical bar stuff. It's pretty obvious that the people manning the kitchen know what the hell they're doing back there. Rarely do I go to a restaurant and have difficulty deciding what to order; at The Mugshot I was torn between a few items.\n\nThey've done a dam good job of ridding the place of all remnants of the defunct McKenzies that used to take up the place. They've clearly spent a lot of time, thought, and energy turning it into something completely new. The environment, painted in bright red and tactfully covered in old-school, famous mugshot photos, is easily the kind of space you could hang out for a long, long time. It's comfortable and welcoming, the way a neighbourhood local should be. Despite not being an overly large place, it still accommodates nicely, and any excess people can spill onto their cozy rooftop patio.\n\nAnd the staff at Mugshot? They couldn't be any friendlier. Having only been open about a week or so, you'd never know it by their attitudes. Likely working long hours, round-the-clock, getting the place ready and established, they're still sociable, out-going, and friendly. I sure-as-hell didn't feel like a stranger in this joint, and I don't think anyone with even the teeniest bit of personality would either. Even coming in by yourself is sure to get you some conversation.\n\nIt's clear that, after just opening, they're still trying to establish their crowd. It's still sorta random as to the people that might be in there. While one day the bar could be full of seniors, that evening it could be packed with a younger crowd. It seems to be dependent on the time of day, but it's also, unfortunately, the way the neighbourhood seems to work. Customers are sorta like family; you can't really pick 'em.\n\nThe Mugshot isn't just the kind of place you sit, drink, and hide from the world, although it provides that pretty well; it's also the kind of place that you can unexpectedly get some truly imaginative and delicious food in a comfortable and welcoming space. In a neighbourhood like High Park, The Mugshot Tavern is unrivaled in every respect.","useful":16,"funny":1,"cool":9}

The uncomplicated menu features classic dishes done beautifully and just a step or two above others'. Five of us arrived for dinner last week and were greeted the charming co-owner, Tom, who presided over the evening with grace and warmth.\n\nWe spent an inordinately long time trying to decide from the 10 appetizers and 10 mains. Each looked better than the next and made our decisions more difficult than usual. While we deliberated, a bottle of shiraz and a custom champagne drink were ordered and a basket of some of the best foccaccia I've had in a long time arrived at the table. The crust was crispy and salty and the filled basket did not last long.\n\nAfter a solid twenty minutes of deliberation, we placed our orders: the romaine heart salad to split two ways; steamed PEI mussels in a grainy mustard butter with a side order of fries; roasted Chicken Supreme stuffed with pulled pork (yes, you read that right) served with bacon & smoked cheddar Israeli couscous; the house burger, made with ground chuck, veal and braised short rib; pan-seared arctic char served atop Israeli couscous with lobster; and roasted halibut topped with salsa verde and served with potatoes and mussels.\n\nWhen the food arrived, five sets of eyes widened. The plates were beautiful and smelled fantastic.  I'm lucky enough to have friends who share, so I got a little of everyone's meal. While all were delicious, there were a few outstanding bites that I would return for which I would The Westerly in a heartbeat. The Israeli couscous with smoked cheddar and bacon was aromatic and, surprisingly, not heavy at all. The smoked ingredients permeated the little couscous pearls, infusing them with a ton of flavour.  Next was the burger which was so tender it nearly fell apart in my hands as I ate it, juice running down my hands. It came with a spicy salsa that cut through the richness of the burger beautifully.  Undoubtedly, this is a big crowd pleaser.\n\nBetween the two fish dishes, I preferred the halibut. I liked the lightness of the fish paired with the bright salsa verde. There was certainly nothing wrong with the char - it was rich, not overcooked and the lobster-laden Israeli couscous was excellent. The balance and combination of ingredients in the halibut dish, though, really appealed to me and I will likely order it upon my next visit.\n\nAmazingly, we had some room left for shared desserts. I opted to split the warm apple crumble with fresh whipped cream while others went for the lemon tart. The crumble was comforting, filled with cinnamon and topped with large, buttery pieces of crumble. Incredible. Definitely a great end to a meal but I recommend sharing as it is quite heavy - otherwise you may be rolling out of the restaurant, pants unzipped.\n\nI would return to The Westerly, unquestionably. My friends and I had a great time in a charming restaurant in which we were treated well (though there was some miscommunication with a dessert, it was rectified gracefully).  If you haven't been, add it to your list and prepare for a lovely brunch or dinner!","useful":0,"funny":1,"cool":0}

I have visited it on several occasions, and each time I leave, I debate whether sharing this place with the world is worth having to wait for a table during an already busy dinner rush. My conscience prevails, as 5 Doors North is too great of a restaurant not to review, and share with my fellow TOFoodReviews readers.\n\nA spur of the moment, \"Thursday night out\" decision, led Andy and I to 5 Doors North, knowing we would get a great meal. We were seated in the front area of the dining room, perfect for people watching along the Eglinton-Davisville and Yonge street corridor. The furnishings are worn, kitschy, and mismatched, but only add to the warmth and charm of the restaurant.  The restaurant menu is hand-written and photocopied, followed by an evolving list of specials on the chalkboard, which are carefully selected, and always guaranteed to be great.\n\nThe wine list is small and filled with some robust reds. I ordered the Pinot Noir, which I have to say, just didn't do it for me, it was a bit thin and wasn't quite what I was hoping for. Andy's Malbec was fabulous, so we both ordered another glass for the second round. Wines by the glass are anywhere from $7 to $11, and bottles in the $30-$50 range. Overall, wines are priced fairly well, but I would love to see a little more variety to match the diverse food menu.\n\nThe appetizer list is long, and everything sounds incredible. They have smoked salmon, Prosciutto, mussels, a delicious polenta dish, on top of the list of daily specials, which included cauliflower soup, avocado bruschetta, and crab cakes. We went with the soup, beef Carpaccio with Pecorino cheese & roasted onion, and the beet salad. First out was the roasted beet salad with scallion aioli & lotus chips, which was wonderful, the goat cheese soft and warm, and the beets sweet and crunchy. The roasted cauliflower soup was smoky and creamy, but not too heavy; a perfect start to the meal, and the beef Carpaccio was some of the best, the cheese and onion offsetting the beef perfectly.\n\nFor our mains, I ordered the gnocchi Gorgonzola special and Andy the braised brisket ravioli. The meals were incredible. The gnocchi was awesome, fresh and soft, but the real winner was the Gorgonzola cream sauce. So creamy, it certainly blew my cheese calorie allotment for the week, but so worth it. Garnished with scallions and fresh pepper, the meal needed nothing more to bring out the strong flavours in the Gorgonzola.\n\nThe braised brisket ravioli was probably one of the more interesting meals we have ever had. I was unsure what to expect, but the beef was perfect, melt-in-your-mouth, wrapped in fresh pasta, with beef au jus and cream to make up the ravioli sauce. It would be worth phoning in advance to see if this was on the specials menu, as this dish just has to be tried.\n\nThe prices are right, entrées run from $14-$20, with appetizers in the $8-$12 range. The service is extremely friendly, with everyone pitching in to seat, serve and check-in. It's a family run restaurant, and you can tell by the attitudes and the recommendations of the staff that they all love the food at 5 Doors North as much as you will.","useful":7,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Bamburger is appealingly decorated in dark brown, natural wood and lots of greenery complimenting the patio and the booths. The lighting is soft and the seating is cozy. This is the kind of place that you could hang out for a great meal without the rushed \"diner\" feeling that often comes with burger joints. Our server was friendly, talkative and more than willing to explain the options on the menu, as there are many, and recommend some personal favourites.\n\nStarting off with drinks, Bamburger serves beer, wine, and old-fashioned Stewart's soda, but what is a burger joint without milkshakes? Bamburger specializes in milkshakes, including the usual vanilla and chocolate suspects, as well a special flavour each day for the nice price of $3.95.\n\nThe menu is varied, offering up soup, salads, sandwiches and desserts, as well as a kid's menu, but almost everyone here is in it for the burgers. Bamburger allows you to choose almost every aspect of your burger, from the type of bun, burger patty (beef, chicken, turkey, pork or veggie), as well as a plethora of toppings, some for the asking- tzatziki, chipotle mayo, olives, horseradish, pickles and banana peppers, and some for a price, $1-$1.50 each- bacon, avocado, onion rings, mushrooms, pineapple, and every kind of cheese you could imagine. Included in these cheesy wonders is \"Bamburger's Signature Cheddar Cheese Sauce ($1.50),\" and it is worth every penny. You can order the cheese sauce on your burger, or as a side for dipping your fries, and I would highly recommend both. Just try not to think of how much butter and cheese have gone into that little bowl, and instead, focus on how delicious it is!\n\nWe went with the \"Bambamburger ($11.50),\" which is 2\/3 of a pound of prime ground chuck, and the chicken burger ($9.95) for myself, on whole-wheat buns. Both of us outfitted our burgers with toppings galore, including mushrooms, onions, garlic mayo and cheese sauce for the \"Bambamburger,\" and avocado, chipotle mayo, dill pickles and jalapeno peppers for the chicken burger. Our meals took a while to arrive, as everything is cooked from scratch, but when they did, we received two overflowing burgers, with awesome homemade French fries and onion rings to match. Lesson learned from this particular trip to Bamburger is just because all of these delectable toppings are available, it doesn't mean you should put all of them on your burger. We both lost our buns to the slippery extras, and ended up eating our burgers by topping, not as one cohesive piece.  Next visit I will try a couple toppings at a time, and see if I fare any better.\n\nBamburger serves up great burgers, fries and shakes at a fairly good price, although if you go a little overboard with the toppings, you might quickly end up with a $20 burger, without realizing it. The service was friendly and engaging, and the atmosphere was very comfortable and neighbourly.\n\nIf you are hunting for a real deal on a burger, Bamburger might not be what you are looking for, but if you are more on the adventurous side, and want to have fun creating your own burger masterpiece, Bamburger will deliver.","useful":8,"funny":0,"cool":3}

That might actually be giving it more credit than it deserves though, because I've been to some cafeterias that aren't absolutely horrible.\n\nI remember stopping in there in the past and having some pretty decent souvlaki, but what you're presented with now is nothing close to decent. The souvlaki is tough and tasteless, the rice is lukewarm and overcooked, the vegetables were likely previously frozen; bottom line is, this is in no way an accurate representation of what Greek food is in Toronto.

Upon arrival we found that this is an odd spot on Queen West where a string of three of four Indian restaurants are all lined up side-by-side, so which to choose?\n\nOne thing I love about Toronto restaurants that you won't always find in smaller cities are menus posted on the outside of the building.  Little India stood out for it's well-organized, easy to understand and well-priced menu - in we went.\n\nIt is definitely an intimate spot, having no real capacity to hold very large groups, but was still quite comfortable for our dining duo. It was a cold Thursday night and not overly busy, so it did not feel crowded, and it gave the servers that much more time to be attentive.\n\nThe menu is substantial and has a variety of dishes. The price range is about $15 - $20 for an entrée, but be sure to ask which ones come with rice or Naan and which don't so that you can order them on the side.  First up was the mixed platter appetizer, which included samosas, onion bhajia, pakora and spring rolls. Everything was crispy, hot and just the right size for something before the entrée-and it came in at under $5.\n\nFor the main, I ordered the chicken kebab and my dinner partner had the Madras chicken.  Fair warning: if they tell you it's going to be hot, then it's truly hot.  We are all too accustomed to those Canadian-ized restaurants that tone down their spiciness to appease the masses, and it is arguable that Little India may do this too, but in any case, take the servers' recommendations to heart.  I do enjoy some heat, but my taste buds can't handle extremes, so I steered clear on this occasion-except for a little taste of the Madras.  For those of you who do like spice, you'll love this!  It has that heat that creeps up after a few bites, not that punch-in-the-face-burn that you might get from cheap chicken wings covered in Frank's Red Hot. Our server did lean my friend toward the less-spicy of the dishes she was deciding between at first, much to her dismay, but as it turns out his suggestion right on.  As for my tamer dish, it had more of a Mediterranean flavour to it; grilled, lemony and came with a cucumber salad garnished with cilantro.  It was a happy reminder of summer while dining in the depths of winter.\n\nOne of the greatest things about this restaurant is something I was not even able to take advantage of: the lunch buffet.  This is a bit of a hike from my own home and workplace, but for those of you in the area, I say go for it!  Buffets have a bit of a bad reputation (and for the most part it's well-deserved), but a small arrangement at a non-chain location like this can be a perfect opportunity to try a variety of what is on the menu, especially if it is food you're mostly unfamiliar with.\n\nOverall, I can't leave you saying it was the very best Indian cuisine I've ever had, but I can say that I wasn't disappointed, and I would go back again-especially for that buffet.","useful":3,"funny":1,"cool":2}

At least that's what the button said that was given to me by the man behind the counter at Pancho's Bakery.  After noticing the small collection I have attached to both my bag and jacket, he was quick to give me a new addition.  I was hesitant to let it join the ranks, after all \"I heart\" anything is a pretty bold statement, and to be honest, as of that moment, I had never had a mind blowing churro experience, or at least one that would have me declaring such strong feelings for them.  The only time I ever ate a churro was at an establishment once promoted by a talking Chihuahua, so you can understand my hesitation.  I pocketed the button, as its fate would be determined later.\n\nPancho's Bakery makes up a portion of what is titled the Latin American Food Court in Kensington Market.  The tiny little storefront on Augusta Avenue is deceiving, as it houses more businesses than I would have guessed.  Assuming it was only Pancho's in the building, I was surprised (and excited) to see a stall selling tacos, another dealing in empanadas, and the infamous pop-up Agave y Aguacate.  Pancho's itself occupies the space right up front, across from the Korean dumpling stand... I'm not sure exactly how they fit in.  Apparently the Latin American Food Court doesn't discriminate, and why should they?  Dumplings are tasty, and well, I'm sure another vendor only helps pay the rent.\n\nIt was around twelve o'clock on a Friday when my friend and I decided to check out Pancho's. Neither of us had eaten, but we couldn't quite justify having churros for lunch. We are of the mindset however, that believes dinner shouldn't be the only meal followed by dessert, so our afternoon repast that day would have a churro chaser.\n\nFull of carnitas tacos, and kimchi empanadas (Korean dumpling cart influence!), but not too full to pass up deep-fried dough, we made our way back to Pancho's.  I was promptly questioned as to the whereabouts of my button but I quickly placed my order as a distraction.\n\nThe churros at Pancho's are piped out in the front window, and brought to life for all too see, before quickly being led to their delicious demise in the deep fryer.  They are served hot, either plain or filled with your choice of chocolate, dulce de leche or strawberry syrup.  We ordered four, one of each flavour, and a plain.  At my servers recommendation I also grabbed some bread pudding and traditional Mexican concha bread.  As we had lost our seats (there aren't many to begin with) and the sun was shining, we took our treats to go.\n\nWe started with the chocolate, moved on to the dulce de leche, followed by the strawberry, and thus ended anticlimactically with the plain. They were crispy and sugar coated on the outside, while soft and (with the exception of the plain) accompanied with a burst of sweetness from within. Churro rookies be warned... a churro is a like a deep fried dough straw.  Any filling that goes in the top, will ultimately come out the bottom.  We left a sticky trail through the streets of Kensington that led back to Pancho's.  If Hansel and Gretel only knew about these, they would have rethought the breadcrumb idea.\n\nLater at home, I popped the bread pudding and concha into the oven.  Concha is a sweet bread that resembles a clam shell, hence the name.  It tasted a little of brown sugar, but overall it was bland.  I think the idea however is to serve it alongside a cup of café con leche or hot chocolate and get to dunking.  I could see this working in its favour.\n\nThe bread pudding however (traditionally served around this time of year to be eaten for Lent) was delicious.  Dense, but very moist, and just sweet enough, my girlfriend went nuts over it. Apparently she doesn't have a problem with dessert after other meals either - and this time it was breakfast.\n\nNow I'm not a fan of donuts, and the churro is essentially the donuts Spanish cousin, but I would take a Pancho's churro over a donut any day, and these are what I will return for.  As it turns out, I really do \"heart\" churros after all.  Now where did I put that button?","useful":2,"funny":2,"cool":1}

It's a good spot if you are looking to throw a large-group party or corporate event dinner. They definitely have room to accommodate large groups for dinner and drinks.\n\nThe menu is set up with shareable appetizers as well as traditional entrees. We tried a variety of starters, all which ranged from $13.50 to $16.50.\n\nFirst, we tried the Louisiana Shrimp Po Boys. This sharable serving came with three Po boy sliders, along with a helping of fries. The shrimp were lightly spiced instead of battered like a traditional po'boy sandwich, and were served with creole tartar sauce, lettuce and tomatoes. The buns were a bit oversized for the shrimp in the sandwiches. Something tells me they are better suited for the hamburger sliders also on the menu.\n\nNext up for appetizers is the Charcuterie Flatbread. This was a great value! The flatbread that came to our table was the size of a small pizza. Each of us had a few pieces, which is a great size for an appetizer. As a big fan of a traditional charcuterie board I was interested in trying this out, and was pleasantly surprised. The meat was not overpowered by the cheese, tomato and sauce base on the flatbread. Would highly recommend this one!\n\nTraditional entrees were next... I tried the Surf n Turf, a new menu item, which was $29. I really liked the unique presentation, which each item set up on a long board instead of a traditional steak and potatoes plate. The steak was cooked exactly as I requested. The lobster tail was a generous size, and the lemon-garlic butter sauce wasn't overpowering at all. It was cooked perfectly too and was very meaty.\n\nUnfortunately, the double cheese baked potato was very dry. It seems like they are premade and had cheese, asparagus, and shallots added and reheated. A simply baked potato would have been a better choice for this one. The attempt at an added flair didn't add much to this dish.\n\nUnder recommendation from our waitress, we also tried the Penne Jambalaya. This huge helping of pasta came with big chunks of chorizo, chicken breast and shrimp, in a Sambucca Cajun cream sauce. The sauce tasted a lot like vodka sauce, for those who have never tried Sambucca before. The portion size was impressive, and the pasta had a good kick of spice to it too. Definitely a win, and at $19 it was well worth it.\n\nOnce 10pm hit, the music was turned up to a deafening level, and other tables of guests began to arrive, including a few party groups with bottle service for the night. We decided it was time to ask for dessert so we could head on our way. The Brownie Cookie Stack arrived at our table with fanfare. A huge firework candle drew the attention from the tables around us as it arrived. It would be great for a birthday party or function, but as a regular dessert accompaniment it was a little over the top. Again, we were pleasantly surprised by the portion size, a stack of 4 huge, thick brownie and chocolate chip cookies with vanilla ice cream and raspberry drizzle, all for $10. Although the presentation was amazing, the ice cream and sauce just couldn't bring out enough from the cookies, which were warm but weren't very moist or chewy.\n\nOverall, the food is comparable to a lot of nightclub-restaurants on King Street in Toronto but at a more affordable price range, and without the 60-minute wait for a table. The service was great, from the manager to the hostesses we felt very welcomed at the restaurant. &Company would be an awesome spot to celebrate your birthday, family function or company party but if you are looking for an intimate dinner party or a romantic evening, this might not be the best choice.","useful":8,"funny":2,"cool":3}

It's likely that you've heard of it, or at least driven by and noticed the huge signage. It's become somewhat of a Leslieville landmark.\n\nFirst things first, I've heard a lot of negative comments about this place. By the sounds of it, it's one of those places that's hit-or-miss and completely different from one visit to the next; amazing one time, awful the next. Because I've never had dinner there, I can't vouch for evening dining, but I can say this: if you truly don't want run the risk of being disappointed, stick with their weekend brunch. This place is known for brunch. While they may have their issues, Joy Bistro has no problems delivering an upscale brunch experience that is chock full of style.\n\nBrunch at Joy Bistro is not really bistro-ish. The brunch food here is mostly just what you'd expect to see on a brunch menu in most Toronto restaurants, but they do their brunch stuff particularly well. Eggs benny is served up in numerous styles like Benetine (with spinach and peameal bacon), Norwegien (with stacked smoked salmon), and Teddy (with peameal bacon, roasted tomatoes, and spinach). With their near-perfect hollandaise, eggs benny at Joy Bistro is a solid choice.\n\nThat, and they've got a killer patio. Intimate and relaxing, their patio is probably one of the best things about this place and the likely reason that a lot of people still frequent it even after having poor experiences. Leslieville has got a few patio spots, but for sheer space, warmth, and location sitting on a busy little Leslieville corner overlooking Jimmie Simpson Park, Joy Bistro's patio is in a league of its own. Worth the sit down in the summer.\n\nThey've recently undergone mass renos, which has resulted in Joy Bistro Bar. Although this may have helped the space modernize, it's also contributed to changing their clientele base. Neighbourhood locals that frequented Joy over the years seem to have gone looking for other spots while those looking for a more trendy experience seem to take over. I guess as Leslieville becomes more popular, Joy Bistro wants to change with the nighbourhood, and while change can be good, in most cases, if it isn't broke them why fix it?\n\nDespite that new clientele, it's still a great place for brunch. So the next time a nice, summer weekend rolls around, head out to Joy Bistro for brunch on the patio. By the sounds of it though, I certainly wouldn't do anything but brunch.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":2}

Maybe its the changing of the seasons, and I'm subconsciously trying to carbo-load for the winter months ahead and preparing for hibernation. Whatever it is, this past Monday I was looking for just that at Terroni on Queen West.\n \nThe camp is divided on Terroni. People either rave about it or complain about the pretentious servers, the 'no-substitution' rule, or the slice-it-yourself pizza. Being a fan of this place, I have a rebuttal for each of these complaints. \n\nWhile (some of) the servers may seem a bit curt at first, I owe this to the fact that Terroni is busy - always busy - and their no-nonsense attitude is often mistaken for pretentiousness. Our server, although brusque, took our order diligently while complementing our choices, had our wine to the table in no time, and managed to pour two glasses of the stuff from the awkwardly shaped porcelain decanter without dribbling it everywhere (which is something we later failed to do). \n\nAs for the no-subsitutions rule, if you want to choose your own toppings, then head on down to that infamous sub-par pizza joint (you know the one...with its orange boxes and redundant title) and stuff your crust while you're at it. Since when did slicing pizza become a chore? Just a few simple back and forth motions with a knife and voila! Freshly sliced pizza.  \n  \nRegardless of the division, Terroni is always packed. Monday at 9:00 found us one free table upstairs, which was where our preference lay anyway. Although I do love to pull up to the bar, it tends to get a bit clustered on the lower level, and while the upstairs isn't exactly quiet, shouting across the table isn't required. \n\nOur waiter promptly brought us the menus and we poured over the apps and the twenty-nine - yes, twenty-nine - pizzas they have to offer.  \n\nWe started with the Funghi Assoluti ($12.95):  breaded and baked oyster mushrooms served on arugula, sprinkled with parmesan, and drizzled with a balsamic glaze.  It was superb, but sharing proved to be problematic, not because the portion wasn't large enough, but because we simply didn't want to. Social graces saved us, but I had visions of the two of us in an Animal Planet-esque showdown... circling the last mushroom with fangs bared and hackles raised. \n \nWe chased all of this down with a velvety Piemonte that was oddly served in a jug, which made it difficult to pour. Our server made it look effortless, but us? Well, we just made a mess. I did manage to solve the problem however (pour from the side, and not from the oddly shaped lip) and fortunately for us we had a seemingly bottomless half litre.\n \nNo sooner had we finished sharing the last 'shroom was our pizza delivered to the table. We went with the Primavera ($15.95) to contribute to our daily recommended dose of veggies and to somehow convince ourselves that we were being healthy. All of the pizza at Terroni is thin crust and ours was weighed down heavily with tomatoes, red pepper, (more) mushrooms, and artichokes with a few black olives decorating the centre of the pie. \n\nNow when I say thin-crust, I mean it.  Maybe I'm just speaking for myself here, but I have absolutely no difficulty finishing a whole pizza without any assistance at Terroni. I'm a big fan of folding slices before biting into them, and the crust at Terroni is so thin and pliable I always envision myself folding a whole pizza in half,...and then in half again...and then having my way with it.  Once again, as with the sharing, social norms seem to get in the way...","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":1}

Last month, David Chang, founder of Momofuku and internationally renowned chef, was in Toronto to play host in an unexpected arena: The TIFF Food on Film series. He joined a sold-out theatre of fellow foodies (including us) to watch his favourite culinary film, Ang Lee's \"Eat Drink Man Woman\", and then engaged the audience in an informal Q&A session that spanned topics ranging from film to the trappings of celebrity chef-hood.\n\nThree hours of salivating over delectable Chinese food on the screen left us craving more than popcorn, so we decided to check out Chang's Momofuku Daisho shortly after...\n\nMomofuku Daisho's ambience is definitely the highlight of the experience. It's open concept and top to bottom glass gives it a simplistic, modern feel. After a successful debut in NYC & Sydney, Chang was lured to Toronto by what he says was a 'perfect and unique' opportunity presented by the Shangrila Hotel: to house three, different takes on his cooking in 1, single building.\n\nWith the accessible Noodle Bar already a favourite of ours and a recent lacklustre (and wallet-busting) venture to the top-rated Shoto, we were eager to try our hand at Momofuku Daisho a mid-level offering that centers the menu around pre-ordered, 'family-style' dishes.\n\nAs you can probably imagine, it can be challenging enough to pick options in the moment, let alone coordinate an order for our group of 7 a week in advance (of which we were), but eager to get the full experience, we pre-ordered the much hyped about fried chicken and beef short ribs. The waitress kindly cautioned us to tread lightly when considering the rest of our order, on account of the deluge of food on the way. (Warning: Consider your wallet and alternative menu opportunities prior to committing to the pre-order. On a do-over, we would have banked one family style dish and ordered the rest off the menu.\n\nFirst we enjoyed two dishes of lightly pickled, chilli-infused cucumbers. If these cucumbers are the Asian take on 'bread and butter' the West is in more trouble than economists predict!\n\nNext came the Spicy Sausage and Rice Cake dish, inspired by Chinese Szechuan cuisine: these melt-in-your-mouth rice cakes punctuated by spiced sausage and Asian greens are a quintessential menu creation, packing flavour of Momofukian proportions!\n\nWe then indulged in a Momofuku classic: a pork-style bun, this time of the deboned chicken wing variety, coupled with dill, a glazey hot sauce and crudité; a real crowd pleaser for our group of 7.\n\nAnd then, the massive plate of fried chicken arrived in all of its glory. Included with vegetables, scallion pancakes (oily and delicious) and a fancy soya type sauce.\n\nLastly, we tried the beef ribeye shortribs flanked by white Kimchi, bean sprouts and some sticky white rice. In our not-so-humble opinion, the ribs were a tad on the fatty side,\n\nWe decided to end the night right and order the chocolate - five different textures of it. A healthy spectrum of liquid to solidity; an interesting experience, but we'd suggest the more intimate smaller size, even for a larger group like ours.\n\nAll in all, we were blissfully overfed at Momofuku Daisho. It was lovely dining with David Chang in town and we luckily caught him at the restaurant to snap a pic. Good friends and good food - what could be better?","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0}

It draws you in as soon as you enter, and it gives you the feeling that you're in for something special.\n\nWith considerate, friendly, detail orientated staff, the service at Globe doesn't disappoint. While it might have partly been because we were among the first tables they had in for dinner that night, we were warmly greeted by the entire front house as we were led to our table. No matter what business you're in, that type of attention scores big points.\n\nTrouble is, I was there to eat, and most of the food at Globe fell a little flat...\nThere's a lot to be said about going local. With hype from the 100 Mile Challenege and a seemingly growing concern for eating local and sustainable, people are looking for food that's produced closer to home and with a smaller carbon footprint. While Globe's focus may be on local, it's hard to identify exactly how close 'local' is since they have items sourced from as far as Kelowna and Vancouver.\n\nThe West Coast Dungeness Crab starter was overcomplicated, which made it slightly hard to identify what the heck we were eating. Besides the obvious crab meat, which was subtly sweet and perfectly cooked, the plate also had a far-to-large savoury panna cotta and some haphazardly scattered popcorn. Yep. Popcorn. While the consistencies were actually pretty good, it was mostly a confusing dish to eat that came with no explanation.\n\nThe Second Winds Farm Elk main was a little too simple; too little color, not enough flavor, and effortless presentation. While the elk loin was perfectly cooked, the braised shoulder was tough and near-tasteless. The best part of the dish was the corn polenta.\n\nMuch the same with the pheasant, which also served the meat two ways. While the citrus breast was moist and tasty, the jerked leg was tough and lacking spices.\nIt's really too bad, because I truly wanted to love Globe. From the beautiful dining room to the amazing staff, I was sure I was in for something special.\n\nPerhaps simpler is better, especially since what we're talking about here is a focus on local ingredients. Great cooking is all about balance, and if Globe could just work on simplifying some of their dishes (like the crab starter) and making others slightly more complicated (like the Elk main) and identify where they draw the line on being local, they'd have nothing stopping them.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Yes, it is completely pitch-black, and no, your eyes will not eventually adjust. You can't see a dam thing down there in O.Noir's dark and dingy basement dining room.\n\nSeriously though, O.Noir is easily one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had in Toronto, not just because the food and service were awful, but also because I left the place feeling ripped off. O.Noir took a concept that could have been interesting and did absolutely nothing with it. It was nothing more than eating crappy food in a dark basement room with the lights off.\n\nFirst off, the food at O.Noir is horrible. It's just glorified, hotel banquet food. You know the stuff: salad with balsamic vinaigrette, pre-cooked steam-table-held vegetables, chicken with coriander sauce. It was all of those boring old courses served at weddings and buffets in the 80s and 90s; there's nothing imaginative going on in the kitchen here. The food had absolutely no bearing on eating in an environment void of light. You'd think that if they were going to block your sense of sight, they'd want to serve food that would heighten your other senses, like food with strong aromas or flavours. Nope. Just unthoughtful, crappy food. In a way, the food was so bad that I'm glad my other senses weren't heightened by the lack of light.\n\nI ordered the 'surprise' menu. I mean really, why wouldn't I? I'd like to at least try to see if I could use my 'enhanced' senses to not only guess but also to better appreciate whatever it was I was eating... For me, the 'surprise' was that I still don't know what the hell I ate. No one ever told me. I sort of assumed that once we were finished eating, the server would have at least told those of us that ordered the surprise what it was we ate so that we could confirm our suspicions, but nope, he just took our plates away without any explanation at all.\n\nSpeaking of our server, he was one of the worst in the biz. Not only did he not bring us anything to drink until we were finished our first course and constantly get our orders mixed up, but he was inattentive and bored; I don't blame him though, it'd be hard not to be bored down there in the dark dining pit of O.Noir. He often left us wondering where he was, not because we were in the dark, but because he often left the room or crept up behind us.\n\nThe seating arrangements leave you feeling bored and isolated too, especially if you're part of a group. In a dark environment, you'd be better off sitting at a round table so that everyone can be part of the conversation. Our seating arrangements at a long, rectangular table left those on the end of the table feeling isolated and alone.\n\nSitting near the entrance to the dining room sucks too. Believe it or not, the servers actually signal that they're entering the room by banging on the door. We must have heard it 40 or 50 times. In a room that is supposed to heighten your senses, this seems absolutely ridiculous. Surely there must be a better way to enter the room and make sure that no light enters. If there is, O.Noir didn't figure it out, or they didn't care. They just decided to stick with the loud banging.\n\nAlthough we couldn't see anything, a quick feel confirmed that we were using those cheapo hotel-style metal chairs and wooden tables. I mean, I know we can't see anything anyways, but if our senses were supposed to be heightened, then surely our sense of touch should be a part of that. You could argue that because you're eating in the dark, the restaurant doesn't need to spend as much on the space, but I'd argue that because you're eating in the dark, the restaurant needs to spend more on the space and everything in the environment needs to be taken into consideration.\n\nOn the way out, the bartender asked us if we were staying in the attached hotel, and right then, it all made sense to me; this place was taking up the old banquet facilities of the hotel. It explains the strange layout the dining room has and the trend of hotel food and furniture. It confirmed one thing for me: if you're going to have a restaurant where your guests eat in the dark, then the space definitely needs to be built specifically for that purpose. There's little doubt that because they didn't, O.Noir sees little repeat business. People come for the novelty, but likely leave disappointed.\n\nO.Noir offers nothing more than eating crappy banquet food in a dark basement with the lights off; absolutely nothing more than that. The pitch-black did nothing to make the experience better or heighten my senses in anyway. I was just eating crappy banquet food in the dark...","useful":15,"funny":3,"cool":1}

This was the case a few days back when a number of friends thought it would be fun to get together at Axis Gastropub on the corner of Bloor and Markham in Mirvish Village.\n\nAxis sits in the old Rocco's Plum Tomato location and is the sister pub to Axis Gallery and Grill in the Junction. This corner seems to be one of the those 'Bermuda Triangle' hospitality locations, with new establishments failing to get a foothold over and over again. Maybe the Axis folks will succeed where others have not.\n\nArriving, a number of us remarked that the large room, decorated in a modern style, was a little stark and very empty for the time of day. It certainly didn't scream 'Pub'.\n\nWithin seconds we were greeted by the two servers\/bartenders and warmly directed to sit wherever we'd like. Both of these guys seemed genuinely happy to see us and quickly told us about the pint special for the day.\n\nTaking a large table in the back of the room, we sat, chatted and waited for our drinks that soon appeared.\n\nPerusing the menu, it was soon clear that this place was trying to please everyone. The choice was almost limitless with the usual pub fare coupled with 'build your own' pizzas and an entrees list that went from curries to fish and all the way back to steak and pasta.\n\nAt the server's recommendation we tried the Pulled Pork Nachos. What came was a healthy portion topped with a mound of pork and all the normal nacho toppings. Tasty, but not remarkable in any way, and the amount of topping-less dead space at the bottom was quite disappointing. Hot wings soon appeared followed by a number of comments of: 'Okay', 'Not stellar', 'Not that spicy'. Following another suggestion, my Axis Club sandwich soon arrived. A Pub staple, the clubhouse has almost as many variations as there are pubs. This club was well prepared, but again not remarkable. Combining chicken breast, ham and bacon on whole wheat bread it was pretty standard, much like what you'd find in a veteran diner or truck stop.\n\nOverall, Axis Gastropub does not live up to its name. It doesn't really feel like a Pub and there isn't anything remarkable about the food. Maybe it is a case of higher expectations, but I can't imagine returning when there are so many other better options nearby.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":2}

It's a fun way to people watch, without really having to watch out for them, but it's also a great way to spot new businesses, or old ones for that matter.  The past couple of times I took this trip, I wondered what was in the chalkboard-black building on the corner of Queen and Elm Grove.  I assumed it was a gallery given it was such a big space, and I was half right.  The Mascot is a coffee shop that showcases art...or an art gallery that serves coffee, depending on what you're going for I guess.  I myself was going for the coffee.\n\nAt first the place is a bit daunting.  It's quite large, with a lot of negative space, and very limited seating.  There are two barstools at the counter, a few tables that can seat more than one, and a surprisingly comfy blue velvet couch in the front room, but patrons need to be ready to get creative if all of those are taken.  The back room, which houses the artwork offers up a couple Victorian chairs for those who feel like working on their posture, an old elementary school chair\/desk combo, and a springy antique rocking horse (???).  I'm not quite sure if that last option is for display only, or for those who like their coffee with a little bouncy nostalgia, but I for one wasn't about to find out.  I used to have one of those horses, and I remember getting pinched by the damn springs on a regular basis.  Luckily for us, there was a free table.\n\nMy girlfriend ordered a latte while I went with just a basic drip to see what Reunion Island coffee is like in its most vulnerable state.  I should've went with the latte.  Not that the drip was bad, but the latte was fantastic. It was smooth and strong without being bitter. The Rosetta adorning the foam was a nice touch as well.  (It should be noted that I went back a few days later for my very own).  \n\nAs it was around the brunch hour, and breakfast had long worn off we decided to get a couple of treats to go with our coffee.  The edible portion of the menu at The Mascot is provided by OMG Baked Goods, and like the seating, selection is limited.  The cupcakes were tempting but we were in the mood for savoury, so we ordered a ham & cheese quiche along with a stuffed foccacia.\n\nThe quiche arrived looking a little bit sad and we faced off as to who would try it first.  We both agreed that it was tastier than we would have guessed, but I've definitely had better quiche.  The stuffed foccacia on the other hand was a nice surprise.  It didn't come to the table looking like much... really just a bun on a plate.  But as with all things stuffed, it's what's inside that counts.  Filled with roasted peppers, artichokes and Asiago cheese, it was not unlike a grown-up Hot Pocket...one that got tired of all the negative attention so it moved out of its parents freezer, and adopted a healthier lifestyle.  The quiche was pushed aside, but later finished - out of hunger alone. \n\nFood however is an afterthought at The Mascot.  From what I saw, the people of Parkdale go for the coffee, and rightly so.  There was a steady stream of people coming and going, and judging by the interactions, quite a few regulars.  With friendly laid-back staff, good ambience and amazing lattes, I would make it my local too - if only I lived anywhere near it.\n\nFootnote:  Seating doubles in the warmer months, when it's comfortable enough to sit on the driftwood looking bench that runs the length of their storefront.  Another good place to do some people watching.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1}

Let me tell you why... One hot and muggy Saturday evening, I found myself walking down College Street in search of sustenance and something cold to slake my thirst. Now, I'm notorious for my inability to make a decision when faced with many options, and College Street has a lot to offer in the way of restaurants. I passed by bistro after restaurant after lounge, growing hungrier by the minute. How did I choose? Divine intervention lent me a helping hand as the sky opened up and let loose a torrential downpour sending me running into the open arms (see: doorway) of Utopia.\n\nIt was already jam packed, which had nothing to do with the rain. There was a line-up for tables, but I managed to grab a seat at the bar to peruse both the menu and the environment. What is it about exposed brick and hardwood floors that make a place so cozy? Whatever it is, Utopia has both.\n\nNeedless to say, I was immediately enamoured, and when I opened the menu, that bubble remained intact. Now, I wouldn't call myself a vegetarian, nor would I dive into a steak with gusto, so for a selectavarian such as myself, I couldn't have designed a more heavenly menu if I tried. All but three of their appetizers are meat free, and they allow you to substitute soy (grilled or breaded & fried) for meat in most of their main dishes. Meat lovers and vegetarians unite!\n\nAnd if that wasn't enough, it gets even better! I forgot to mention earlier that in between appreciating the exposed brick and opening the menu, I honed in on the beer selection (tunnel vision at its finest). And it made me smile, for they had KLB Raspberry Wheat on tap. Typically, I like my beer to taste like, well...beer, but I make an exception for KLB, especially in the summertime (although I find excuses to drink it at other points in the year) as the natural raspberry essence paired with the beer itself is possibly the most refreshing combination ever. Like angels dancing on my tongue...delicious, raspberry angels. Its difficult to find on tap, and Utopia has it, so I chalk them up some more points.\n\nI started with the Mumahari Dip (roasted red peppers, pomegranate molasses and walnuts) that comes served with naan. While the dip itself wasn't exactly visually appealing (but really how many dips are?) with a likening to cat food, I was willing to overlook it. The Everlasting Gobstopper of dips, every bite of the Mumahari started sweet, moved onto nutty and finished with a bit of a kick. Delish.\n\nBetween the dip and the KLB, I was already very satisfied, but I wasn't done yet. Next came my Grilled Veggie & Goat Cheese Burrito. I love a good burrito, and this one didn't disappoint. Grilled zucchini, red peppers, eggplant, onions and a generous layer of goat cheese came wrapped in a soft tortilla. Served alongside substantial sides of both garden salad and rice, I couldn't finish it if I tried...and I tried. There is absolutely nothing wrong with leftovers though, and I can vouch that a Utopia burrito tastes just as delicious the day after.\n\nOn a tight budget? All of Utopia's mains hover around the $13 mark which in my opinion is a great deal considering the quality of the food and the very sizeable portions. I can easily see two people splitting a burrito and leaving the place with full stomachs (and wallets). The only problem with this scenario however, is the lack of leftovers.\n\nIf Utopia has any drawbacks, it's that the place is hot in the summer - really, really hot. The lack of air-conditioning combined with the open kitchen may have something to do with it. If I were anywhere else, I just may have been uncomfortable, but I had my pint of KLB, exposed brick, and a smiling bartender that made me feel like I was the only person in the room (okay...now I'm just getting carried away, but that being said the service is genuinely warm). Looking around, even though everyone had a sheen to them, nobody seemed to mind. Everybody just looked happy. People don't sweat at Utopia...they glow.\n\nFor a pasta-heavy neighbourhood, Utopia provides a nice deviation. It's the kind of place I could eat at everyday, so it's probably a good thing I don't live nearby, but it will definitely be my College Street go-to. They also have a four season patio (another good reason I don't live in the area, as much to my liver's chagrin, I have an almost instinctual draw to drinking outside).\n\nUtopia is a contradiction unto itself: it's frenetic, but it's calm; blazers sit next to longboarders; meat lovers co-exist amongst vegetarians; it's hot, but oh so cool. As its name implies, this Bohemian spot in Little Italy is truly ideal.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":2}

What makes the experience at Nota Bene so incredible is the total lack of pretense in a restaurant that could easily come across as pompous, and still attract a devoted clientele.\n\nYou might find yourself dining with a local politician or celebrity, and a couple celebrating their wedding anniversary, all in the same place. The price is accessible, the quality of the food impeccable, and the service instant without being overwhelming.\n\nWe started the evening with Chef David's lobster tacos and the margarita fiesta specials. The lobster tacos were served in a lettuce shell, with a chipotle cream, veggies and cilantro ($8). They tasted like something you would find in a great coastal city, and not at all heavy. The lobster special is a great way to settle in to a long evening of wonderful food.  The margaritas were phenomenal, served on the rocks with Avion tequila. We tried a couple of the cocktails and loved \"Chef David's\" traditional margarita with smoked sea salt. The blueberry and pine tips margarita sounds like a bit of an odd marriage, but worked so wonderfully together that we ordered another.\n\nFor appetizers we started with the Hamachi ceviche, which is a yellowtail Pacific fish, infused with coriander, lime, avocado, and jalapeño ($16). This dish came highly recommended by our server, and was absolutely worth the hype. The jalapeños offered a very spicy take on the dish, tempered by the avocado and lime.\n\nNext we tried the cavatelli pasta, with a truffle-scented mushroom Bolognese ($16). This dish was surprisingly soft and creamy without any cheese in it, and the truffle mushrooms were divine. We also had the crisp duck salad with sumac green papaya slaw and cashews ($15), and although I am self-admittedly duck averse, I am told it was perfectly crispy and flavourful, and ending up being the favourite appetizer of the evening for my companion.\n\nFor our mains we ordered two Nota Bene favourites. I went with the wild Digby sea scallops with avocado purée, Thai curry paste, mango, papaya and peanut salad ($28). For such a tropical sounding dish, the scallops actually had a very Canadian East coast feel to them, the avocado puree adding a creamy compliment to the scallops. Nota Bene specializes in preparing excellent seafood, and I would absolutely come back for this dish again.\n\nWe also tried the braised beef short rib with corn truffle, pickled red onions, queso añejo and coriander ($29). The short ribs were tender, succulent and combined with the sharp taste of the queso añejo and the acidity of the pickled red onion, they were layered with flavour and flat out delicious.\n\nWith dinner, we ordered a glass of Ontario Pinot Noir and an Argentinean Malbec. The wine list at Nota Bene is extensive, with the full spectrum of bottles, ranging from the $70 to several hundred.\n\nFor dessert we sampled sticky toffee pudding ($12) and S'More ice cream ($10). Needless to say, the sampling turned into finishing. Both desserts were exploding with flavour, the pudding a great combination of traditional pecan praline and spotted dick ice cream, taken with a strong espresso; this is dessert to die for. The S'More ice cream was a fun take on the campfire favourite, with a chocolate and graham cracker crumble.\n\nGo try Nota Bene, twice.  Once to become familiar with all that this brilliantly conceived restaurant has to offer and then a second time to cement the relationship in your black book of regular haunts. Service, quality and ambience are all top rate, yet you still feel the passion Nota Bene has for creating a wonderful experience and forming personal relationships with its guests.\n\nSee you there...","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I've been looking through what other people have said about Megas, and it's all so bad...really bad. That's where the trouble comes in for me, because I certainly didn't hate it as much as everyone else seems to. In fact, I actually thought I was going to be giving Megas more then 3 stars with this review. Why? This is the second time I've been to Megas. I was only going again because it was so good the first time. But the second time wasn't even a close second.\n\nThe big plus Megas has got going for them is their killer patio right on the busier stretch of the Danforth. It's probably one of the best places to sit outdoors on the street. It's a big, covered space that's chock full of people, and at first glance, is difficult not to gravitate towards on a sunny day. \n\nOnce you get over the patio though, and it comes to eating, you're likely to be disappointed; but it's completely dependent on what you order and when you order it. The food at Megas is mostly mediocre, but there are a couple things worth mentioning. While the rice is of the reheated, overcooked, slightly warmed kind, the Saganaki (fried Feta cheese made of sheep's milk) and Taramosalata (Cod caviar spread) is probably some of the best on The Danforth. Seriously, if you have never tried either of these, this is the place to do it. But everything else, order with caution. This place is completely hit or miss, mostly depending on how busy they are.\n\nThe inside is sorta your typical Greek place: fake roman statues, stone pillars, and lots of greenery; it's a big space too. If you check it out on the weekend, chances are that big space will have more than one big group, which Megas can provide for comfortably. But that's where most of their issues lie. While they may be able to provide for big groups, it's at the sacrifice of all the other tables. Once Megas gets busy, the service, food quality, and overall experience seemingly drops right through the floor.\n\nUnfortunately, the one thing that is truly consistent at Megas no matter how many times you go there is their lack of caring for food presentation. While most of the stuff they serve seems to be haphazardly dropped on the plate, I don't blame Megas for that. After all, that's pretty much a standard for Greek food; it never seems to be about the presentation. When it comes to Greek food, there's never really a big surprise with what you end up with at your table. You order calamari? It's probably served garnished with parsley and olive oil. You order hummus? It's probably served garnished with olive oil and a lone Kalmata olive. The only difference varying from place to place is whether it's tasty enough to be worth eating.\n\nI'm still slightly confused about whether to recommend this place or not. I mean, they've got a few things going for them. Like I said, the first time was pretty good, and if I knew I was guaranteed that every time, I'd have no problems returning.  Megas basically comes down to this: if the place isn't busy, stop in and check it out; if they are busy, keep walking.","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":1}

Without giving you an exact number of how many years it's been, I will tell you that Gap wanted everyone in khakis, pagers weren't quite obsolete, and Mambo #5 was tearing up the charts.  So thankfully a lot has changed, but two things remain, and will always remain the same, about student life.  Number one:  students are broke.  Number two:  they are hungry.  Say Cheese is going to make many U of T students very happy. \n\nI haven't met a grilled cheese sandwich I didn't like, and I haven't met anyone that doesn't like a grilled cheese sandwich.  That might be why so many gourmet grilled cheese places are popping up these days, but it's a risky business.  The people have spoken and they want grilled cheese sammies...but they don't want to pay a lot for them.  After all, you can make a perfectly good one at home with white bread, and cheese that's more plastic than it is dairy.  And that's where Say Cheese comes in.  Nigel Koo, part owner and operator wants to satisfy stomachs without putting a dent in wallets.  He doesn't see why he can't serve up a high quality sandwich at a low(ish) cost and have customers walking out in a lactose induced ecstasy.\n\nIt was quiet when I arrived but word wasn't really out yet, and the boys were still experimenting in their test kitchen.  I was happy to be a guinea pig.  I asked to try their most popular meat and veggie options, and this is what followed.  \n\nI started with Indira's Pulled Pork made with Beemster.  Diners can choose to have regular cheese, such as cheddar, on their sandwich ($6.50) or upgrade to a premium choice ($8.50). My creation came topped with homemade mac & cheese (fun!) on whole wheat bread.  I only ate half as I had more coming my way, but the sandwiches here are generous, and I had to pace myself.  The different textures paired nicely, but I would have liked it more had the meat been a touch saucier, or came with something in which to dip it.\n\nNext, came the Italian Classic.  Not that I'm taking bets, but if you put Buffalo mozzarella on anything, I will eat it.  So I was pleased when they said one of their best meatless sellers was filled with the stuff.  I like a good Margharita pizza, and this was the sandwich version.  \n\nAs if that wasn't enough (and by all dietary standards, it was more than that) I was offered their dessert sandwich.  It didn't take a lot of prodding, and went something like this;\n\n Nigel:  You should try our dessert option. \n\n Me:  Wow, I don't know.  I'm really stuffed.  Okay.\n\nThe French Grilled Toast is like a ménage a trois between a grilled cheese, some French toast, and a piece of cheesecake. It's good.  Scary good.  Filled with ricotta, mascarpone and a berry compote, the sandwich is then dusted with turbinado sugar, and drizzled with maple syrup.  As with French toast, this needed to be eaten with a knife and fork, which probably worked in my best interest as it stopped me from inhaling it.  I will be going back for this one.  As it is now, I think about it more than anyone should think about a sandwich.\n\nSo in total I ended up eating just a little bit more than a full sandwich thanks to the few bites I had of the French toast, and I was beyond full.  So much so, that I actually skipped dinner that night. Now by my calculations, that equals two meals for the price of one, and a low price at that. This bodes well for hungry students up to their necks in debt.  \n\nFootnote:  During the week, for a mere thirty minutes between 4:20 and 4:50 you can get yourself a sandwich and side (including soup, salad and possible ramen...) for just $4.20.","useful":11,"funny":1,"cool":3}

After all, the arrival of littlefish in the Junction has definitely been well received. The neighbourhood has been waiting an awfully long time for a cool, hipster-worthy brunch spot. Unfortunately, the arrival of littlefish hasn't completely filled that void just yet. They still have a few kinks to work out, but don't give up on them yet. I won't, but only because I really want to love it.\n\nOk. First off, this is a pretty cool restaurant. Besides the obviously brilliant name, littlefish is a great little place to grab weekend brunch. It's small, only about 8 tables or so, but that just makes it all-the-more cozier and comfortable. It's a long, narrow space filled with exposed red brick and shiny metal airducts. The daily specials, scrawled and displayed on a suspended chalkboard, are imaginative, original, and well-thought-out.\n\nThe brunch menu is pretty much what you'd expect to see. They have everything from French toast and eggs benedict to pancakes and crepes. Best of all, they seem to make everything from scratch with good ingredients.\n\nThe staff goes out of their way to be friendly and to make sure you have everything you need to feel comfortable. Constantly being checked on, I never found myself without a full cup of hot coffee, but I suppose that's sort of expected in a place that only seats about 30 people.\n\nThe thing that's not expected in a place this size is the ridiculous wait time for food. When I was there, it seemed as though everyone in the whole place waited 45 minutes to an hour for their orders to arrive; I know I definitely did. If they were understaffed, I couldn't understand it; there were at least 5 people in the exposed kitchen, none of them seeming to be moving with any sense of urgency. Definitely not understaffed here. The whole place seemed to be in a state of organized chaos. The front counter was covered with papers and dishes, and the visible part of the kitchen was overcrowded with food containers and crowded counterspaces. Organized chaos, but just barely contained.\n\nPeople rave about the food here, but I really don't see it. My eggs benny was, meh, ok, but they certainly weren't anything to get excited about. They were warm but not hot, and the side of potatoes was mostly burned. My daughter had their now 'Internet famous' French toast. With burned edges on an overcrowded plate, they were even less than meh.\n\nMake no mistake though, this place was busy. Newcomers are put on a couch to wait until a table vacates, but they are offered coffee. If you're planning on getting a table on the weekend, be prepared to wait. So why so busy? Personally, I think a lot of it has to do with the neighbourhood's lack of options. I'd be willing to bet that although littlefish may be doing well in the Junction, had they been on a more brunch heavy area, like West Queen West, they may not be doing as well as they are now.\n\nSo would I go back to littlefish? Sure. I'd like to give them another chance. I think the whole neighbourhood would. After all, the Junction needs a place like littlefish as much as littlefish needs a neighbourhood like the Junction.","useful":7,"funny":1,"cool":2}

In my continuing effort to find superior pizza, I looked to Lil' Baci in Leslieville. My visit didn't disappoint me.\n\nLil' Baci's dining room is a decent-sized dining space, but the tables are packed pretty tight, so don't expect too much privacy. You'll likely hear everything that the table next to you is talking about. If you need to escape your neighbour table, in the warmer months you may want to check out the cute backyard patio. Comfortable, busy, and social, it's the place to be when the sun is out.\n\nWhen I'm eating Italian food, I like to start off with a glass of red vino or cold Italian beer. Lil' Baci's wine list is small but thorough and their beer list offers some nice Italian choices; Moretti and Perroni are my personal favourites.\n\nLil' Baci has a seriously amazing dandelion greens salad.  If you've never had dandelions as food before, this would be the one to expose yourself to it. The greens are slightly bitter, but the bitterness works well topped with shaved Parmigiano, cracked black pepper, and freshly squeezed lemon. Perfect starter.\n\nAnd the pizza, they do it right. Lil' Baci has a savoury and seasoned tomato sauce base that expertly compliments the four cheeses that are layered on their Quattro Fromagi; my personal favorite.  They've got some other really outstanding pizzas to choose from like the Margherita (with tomato, basil, and mozza), the Lil' Baci (with pecorino, sausage, and fennel pollen), and the Gorgonzola Dolce (with gorgonzola, Yukon gold potatoes, and caramelized onions). All of their pizzas are served on signature thin crust dough that is seared and blistered perfectly.\n\nLil Baci has got a really small pasta menu. Ridiculously small. There's only three items. But still, these 3 items are done perfectly. They're all made with quality ingredients and use that great tomato sauce that's on the pizza. My favorite is just the plain ole' Spaghetti and meatballs.  It's got just the right amount of fresh basil, sauce, and Parmigiano. The portion size isn't huge, but with that dandelion salad and something from their Insalata menu, it's more than enough.\n\nLil' Baci also has a Panino menu, which surprisingly is different from their pizza menu. I love the Panino Tonnato. Packed with Italian tuna, caper aioli, sun-dried tomatoes and arugula, it's perfectly pressed into an amazing bite.\n\nThe dessert menu has a few options, but when I was there I had a lemon prosecco tart. The crust was buttery, but a tad on the dry side. The custard-like lemon filling had a refreshing prosecco flavour, which balanced the acidity nicely.\n\nI head to Lil' Baci when I want some decently priced Italian food and some amazing pizza. Lunch or dinner, what you end up with is a steal anywhere in the city!","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":2}

That's usually a good sign, and in this case it's definitely true. But waiting for a table isn't all bad; there's lots to see in this place: kitchy cute decor and lots of memoribilia that reminded me of my childhood. When I was there, the place was cramped and full of hungry people, but everyone was in good spirits. \n\nWhen I look at the menu, i always find it difficult to make a choice. They've got a big, diverse menu with both savory and sweet items. All of it looks delicious.  \n\nFirst off, I'm a vegetarian, but, like to get the breakfast pocket, sans pemeal bacon of course.  It's chock full of fluffy eggs, caramelized onions, mayo and cheddar cheese on a warm and soft onion bun. Aunties and Uncles encourages you to choose between a few sides, but I've never chose anything but the potato salad. Seriously, this stuff is good. A great combo of chunky red potatoes, dill, Dijon and spices, it's savoury and creamy. Admittedly, my food did and usually does take a bit of time to arrive, so if you go, don't go when you're in a hurry.\n\nFruit juices and iced teas are good choices, but I wouldn't finish off with an espresso as they may suggest. Their espresso is nothing special and just plain weak, and it certainly doesn't stand up to Manic coffee located just a few doors down. If you're craving an after-meal-caffiene-fix, I'd suggest you head over to Manic.\n\nAunties and Uncles loses points in service. The service staff seem a bit cold, sorta aloof, and alot grouchy, but despite if you're willing to overlook that, then this is worth a visit if you're in the College & Bathurst area.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

You'd think that there wouldn't be much to be said about greasy Mexican food, but that doesn't seem to be true in La Hacienda's case. Not on my part though; they've got a pretty decent reputation online, particularly where weekend brunch is concerned. The Internet is full of lots of reviews, lots of check-ins, and lots of positive feedback.\n\nI'd say most of that good stuff online about them is dead wrong. \n\nLa Hacienda is a decent little place at first walk-in: cozy, dimly lit, the kinda place you'd expect to find on this stretch of Queen West. With a mostly-covered back patio full of comfortable seating and nicely placed greenery, it seems like the perfect place to hide on a Sunday afternoon.\n\nBut one thing is for sure, it isn't the perfect place to eat. The menu is mostly unimaginative with few signs of thought or effort. Boring chicken and beef burritos and greasy chorizo hash is what you'll be eating. Mostly everything comes with a side of their store bought corn chips and homemade salsa, but again, that salsa isn't made with any degree of love or passion for food; just a bunch of cubed tomatoes with little seasoning. La Hacienda sure doesn't have the fresh-chopped tomatoes and cilantro and killer guacamole you'd expect of a Mexican joint. This place doesn't have one dam authentic thing about it. \n\nPerfect for a hot, Sunday afternoon, they also serve in-house made Sangrias by the glass or pitcher. Unfortunately, they're far from perfect too. Cheap red wine, mixed with pre-frozen orange juice, and few bits of floating fruit, it's again, a big miss from the freshness most people associate with Sangrias. Call me crazy, but for 6 bucks a glass, I want some fresh-squeezed orange juice and fresh slices of orange and limes cut specifically for that purpose. I want the red wine they choose to have flavour that compliments citrus, not just whatever is laying around and recently opened.\n\nOn this particular day, La Hacienda was brutally understaffed with one server and one cook; hardly enough to accommodate the back-patio alone, nevermind the front of the place. While still friendly, the server was obviously struggling to keep everyone happy; never returning to check on how people liked their food, which I assume they didn't. She was so busy in fact, that I didnt even have the heart to tell her how crappy everything was for fear that one misguided detail like that would throw her off her game completely.\n\nSeriously, this place is should be on your avoid list. There is absolutely nothing special, or Mexican for that matter, about it at all. It's just greasy, over-priced, 'Mexican' themed food served in a hipster shop on Queen West. If you're looking for authenticity, you've got a ton of other way-better options in this city.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":1}

Despite the obvious assumptions, Murray does not take kindly to eating regular old hot dogs. He prefers a more delectable, refined meal. What does Murray like the most? Sandwiches, of course! In fact, he loves them so much that he  used all of his love and expertise to build a sandwich shop for his fellow sandwich lovers. Thus, Murray's Sandwich Emporium sprang to life.\n\nI recently found myself in the exact same conundrum as Murray the dog was; I was sick of my same-ol'-same-ol' packed lunches, and I was searching for something better. I know you're thinking that sandwiches have to be the most cliché lunch choice of them all, but one look at Murray's menu, and you'll know that you're in for something much different. \n\nThere is not a huge selection (by sheer number) at Murray's, but each item is unique, and there is a decent range of combinations across the board. There are meatless, chicken, beef, fish, cheese and even sweet sandwiches, plus a decent offering of sides (note: combos and sides are extra). \n\nThe restaurant itself is pretty simplistic. It's small, has exposed and undecorated brick walls and two large wooden tables with stools scattered around them. The chalkboard menu hangs on the wall, and there is a small refrigerator full of beverages just off to the side. It is all very subdued and quite appropriate for a sandwich shop.\n\nI held back a bit on my first trip to Murray's. I didn't really know what to expect, how big the servings would be, and what kind of value I would find there. I decided to go with The Uncle Phil: sliced ribeye, onions, green peppers and ooey, gooey, messy, melty provolone cheese on a beautiful baguette. \n\nTruthfully, I thought the bread was the best part of this sandwich. I don't feel bad for discounting the meat or toppings because, for sandwiches at least, the bread is just as much a star in the meal as anything else. The baguette was clearly very fresh, they keep it tender (but crispy) and most importantly, not over or under-stuffed. The meat was tender too, but it needed a bit more oomph. The green peppers were just slightly sautéed, giving them a nice crunch and, as mentioned above, the cheese was gloriously gooey. All of that was topped off with a pickle - for nine bucks!\n\nI felt that I didn't really get the whole experience of Murray's my first time around, so on my second visit I decided to get into some side dishes. I certainly didn't hold back on my sandwich choice with The BL-Tizzy - double smoked B, of course some L and T, house-made mayo, avocado and an egg (a $1.00 add-on). I threw all of that into a combo with some onion rings and a can of pop, bringing my total to $12 plus tax. This is a bit pricey in my opinion, but considering the amount of food they give you, it's not so bad. Here again, I thought the bread stood out more than anything else. It was so fresh and tasted of near perfection. Just like The Uncle Phil, the fillings were good but, other than the sheer volume, they were fairly regular...tasty, but regular.\n\nOverall, Murray's Sandwich Emporium offers a delicious product that is definitely over-sized and that will satisfy your hunger. Plus, they're open for lunch, dinner and late-night eats. However, as tasty as the sandwiches are, I can't say anything really blew me away. Yes, the menu item names are unique and fun and the serving sizes are huge, but nothing is really over the top. That being said, sometimes simple is best; they know what they're good at, they know how to make a good sandwich, and they're consistent. \n\nGood boy, Murray.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1}

I paid $22 for a burger lunch and am absolutely ok with it.\n\nGrindhouse is serious carnivore territory.\n\nThe first thing to stand out, though, was my drink. I went for my usual diet cola and I got, \"Sorry we don't have anything with aspartame.\" In fact, you shouldn't go there expecting to get your go-to big brand soft drink at all. Well, well, well I better go for something really interesting then. Boylan's Birch Beer - a root beer drink, sweetened with cane sugar, with pure vanilla extract and only one preservative (sodium benzoate, typically used in soft drinks and other acidic preserves). Their amazing dedication to fresh and natural ingredients obviously did not end there.\n\nAll of the ingredients are local and fresh, the burger meat comes from naturally raised livestock and is Genetically Modified Organism, hormone and antibiotic-free. You will not find anything that has refined sugars, or artificial sweeteners (hence the lack of Coca-Cola and Pepsi on the premises). They literally prepare everything in-house. The buns are made there and they also make the ketchup and mustard themselves, right in the back kitchen. The \"fresh and never frozen\" attitude is not good enough here; if you're going to do it, do it right.\n\nTheir burger creations are unique and creative; a turkey burger with black truffles and cranberries, yes they do have a veggie burger and it's soy-free and, my choice, the black and blue burger are just a few of the menu items. I was presented with a Cajun spiced beef patty smothered in blue cheese sauce and cooked only to medium, with a side of onion rings (who was I kidding with that diet cola anyway).\n\nIf you can be sure of the meat quality, requesting a burger cooked less than well-done will give you much more flavour and a better texture. On my first bite there was an immediate rush of barbecue charcoal flavour emanating from the patty; it tasted like summertime. The blue cheese sauce was mild and, considering the Cajun description, it was spiced, not spicy. The onion rings were huge and somehow satisfyingly greasy but unbelievably crispy.\n\nI actually don't often talk about presentation because, frankly, it's all about the taste for me. I have eaten enough beautiful yet disappointing and ugly yet amazing dishes to spend much time considering plating. However, the simple beauty of this burger and onion rings dish was lovely - just a white plate and a burger, without a toothpicked-pickle piercing the bun. Lovely.\n\nMuch like my University professors, I hesitate to give out a \"perfect\" score and I can't on good conscious say that this was the very best burger in the city, but - a big but - they gave me something pretty darn close to the best burger around and the attention paid to good, fresh and healthful ingredients truly impressed me.\n\nTheir name might be harsh and gory, but you'll find burger-fare inside that is gentle and kind to you and your body.","useful":3,"funny":1,"cool":1}

Being situated in a bit more of an upscale mall, Aux Delices caters to their clientele. Health conscious foodies will delight in their selection of fresh, gourmet ingredients, including Panini's, pastas, crepes, salads, and even specialties like duck l'orange and homemade gelato, just to name a few. There menu is ever changing, depending on seasonal availability, so there is always something new to try at Aux Delices.\n\nWe started our meal with the fresh manicotti and roasted mushroom caps, duck l'orange with mushroom and greens, and roasted eggplant salad. Everything tasted like fresh, home cooking. The manicotti ($6.50) was amazing, with melt-in-your-mouth ricotta, and ripe tomatoes that tasted like they were picked form the garden that morning. The stuffed Portobello mushroom cap with cheese and polenta was an awesome side dish, complementing the Italian flavours in the manicotti, but would be great as an entrée on its own.\n\nThe duck l'orange was cooked perfectly, tender and succulent, the sauce was sweet and tangy, and the accompanying side salads of oyster mushrooms and greens, and roasted eggplant were in a league of their own. I would have returned just to try a sampling of all their fresh veggie salads.\n\nNext up, a roasted vegetable Panini, recommended by our host. The yellow pepper, red onion and eggplant were soft and easy to eat, with a nice portion of goat cheese on lovely focaccia bread. Moving into crepe territory, we decided to tackle the ham and cheese crepe ($9.50), with tomatoes as well, and would go back for more. Their crepes are light and fluffy, and packed with ingredients. Even better, your crepe is made right in front of you, and you can add any ingredients you like. A fun experience for kids, too.\n\nFor those looking for the \"café\" experience, they serve up delightful illy coffee, and Rahier desserts, that almost make you feel like you are dining in Europe. Their double espressos were great, nice and bold, and the latte was perfect, frothy and steamed to perfection. The homemade gelato was amazing. I love ice cream, and have been a latecomer to the gelato trend, but I am glad that I tried it. We sampled the chocolate, vanilla and pistachio, a must when having gelato, and they were all very well done. The vanilla and chocolate especially, both true to their flavours, with a natural, nuttier taste, rather than overtly sweet.\n\nAux Delices Café offers a fabulous dining experience, and allows you to stop in for a fast and easy meal, or linger over a cup of coffee and a pastry. All of their meals are available to go, making it a great option to stop in after work for a ready-made meal.\nGourmet meals ready as soon as you order, great coffee and homemade gelato should have you stopping for a break on your next shopping trip.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Why are people flocking to these brightly coloured, frosted, palm-sized desserts? Well, I'm sure there is some greater social commentary to be made here about a reversion to childhood or a need for comfort foods in our over-stressed, over-worked lives, but, in the case of Prairie Girl Bakery, it's just simply that they taste so darn good!\n\nWalking into Prairie Girl Bakery is almost like entering a fine clothing store - everything is placed just so. The whole space is pristinely clean and clear of clutter; literally nothing exists except a counter and back-wall display. The cupcakes are kept safely behind the employees, lined up row by row waiting to be selected and boxed up. All of the focus is on their one and only product. There is no time wasted on brewing coffee, serving tea, or making sandwiches. Everything comes down to one thing: the cake and the icing.\n\nWhen I first walked into the store, I thought I made a mistake. I went in to grab a dozen cupcakes for a work function and was shocked at the lack of merchandise on the shelves. I had to ask, \"was I supposed to pre-order before coming in?\" Not at all. They just take extra care to provide the freshest product possible, promising never to serve a \"day-old cupcake.\" So, baking in big batches to keep the shelves stocked to the brim all day is out of the question. The team at Prairie Girl Bakery prides itself on being resourceful and limiting waste; they even take any leftover cupcakes to a local charitable organization, Toronto's Second Harvest, that is dedicated to providing realistic solutions to hunger. Are cupcakes a necessity for a charitable food organization? Of course not, but why not give where you can and provide something a bit more luxurious than canned food to those in need.\n\nThe cupcakes come in two sizes, 13 flavours, and an array of beautiful colours. You won't find any unneeded extras here, like (in)edible sugar flower toppings disguising an otherwise delectable treat. The cakes are simple and the swirls of icing are in the spotlight on top of light bases. The range of flavours include peanut butter banana, red velvet with classic cream cheese icing, chocolate-chocolate, chocolate-vanilla, chocolate-hazelnut, chocolate cake with peppermint icing, and my ultimate favourite, chocolate cake with strawberry icing. The strawberry colour was fairly mute, but the flavour was intense. Even more impressive was that the chocolate cake didn't overpower the icing or vice versa. Each deep flavour perfectly complemented the other.\n\nA dozen mini-cupcakes come in at $18.95 and one dozen regular size at $31.95. My gluttonous side will only order the mini cupcakes from now on, allowing me to eat two or three different flavours in one sitting. However, there is something supremely gorgeous about the sight of one of their regular sized cupcakes sitting in it's very own container (complete with viewing window) waiting only for you.\n\nWant to feel a little less guilty about completely indulging in these sinfully tasty treats? Prairie Girl Bakery's dedication to remaining as all-natural as possible streams throughout the whole operation. Not only do they use recyclable cardboard packaging, but they are absolutely free of preservatives, artificial flavours, and hydrogenated or \"trans\" fats. I'd say that's mostly healthy eating.\n\nOn one final note, I have to say that I love the mythology around this place. The story is that Prairie Girl Bakery's creator, Jean Blacklock, learned all she knew from her family back on her Saskatchewan farm. She eventually left a career in law to bring that down home prairie, old fashioned baking to us city-dwellers. I don't think there could possibly be more charm or more beauty in the simplicity of what Prairie Girl Bakery is and what they produce.","useful":2,"funny":2,"cool":3}

The restaurant is decked out art-deco style, with lots of white tile, dark wood and vintage posters lining the walls. Coquine boasts several large dining rooms and a quaint patio, perfect for people watching or a leisurely meal. A large group of us descended on Coquine one Sunday morning for a late brunch, and found the menu to be both classic and eclectic. Let me explain. .\n\nTraditional Sunday morning brunch normally sees a line-up of the usuals; pancakes, omelets and waffles. While Coquine serves up all of these items, they do it all with a pronounced French flavour, not afraid of adding a little gourmet to your breakfast.  Coquine's wonderful Apple Jack's ($11) offers up a stack of fluffy pancakes, topped with delectable caramelized apple and maple syrup. The delightful Vanilla French Toast ($12) is flavoured with fresh vanilla bean and served with a berry compote and Chambord. The Steak Frites ($19) were delicious, and came with a side of Parmesan truffle fries and mayo. While you may not be able to fly to Paris for weekend brunch, you can certainly enjoy the savoury French-style cuisine just south of Yonge and Eglinton.\n\nEveryone found their meals to be excellent, and I can personally attest to both the quality and quantity of the wild mushroom and shallot Quiche with chévre ($14). Coffee (and Bailey's) was always available, and attentive extras like water for the group, and non-stop breadbaskets make the service at Coquine both pleasant and under-stated.\n\nOverall, the value for meals was very good, as portions were large, and fit for sharing. Both the hostess and the server were polite and attentive, but never obvious. With an excellent location between Davisville and Eglinton subway stops, and great food and service, Coquine should be on your list as a must-try for weekend brunch.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":1}

Sitting in a little space out in the Bloor and Lansdowne, Nuthouse has established itself with Blansdowne locals as the best place around to pick up all sorts of interesting products.\n\nFirst thing you'll notice about Nuthouse is that it smells good...it smells really good...it smells like an incredibly nice mix of high-quality nuts, cereals, grains, teas, dried fruit, lentils, dried fruit, spices, cake, and coffee. It's a smell that right away makes you feel comfortable and assures you that what you're getting is filled with quality. Don't expect to see the typical bulk fare with hundreds of bins full of overly processed and mass-produced stuff; you're in the wrong place for that sorta thing. Nuthouse is full of nothing but always high quality and sometimes organic products.\n\nOk. That might not be the very first thing you notice. Chances are, if you're walking down Bloor looking for this place, or even if you're not looking for it, the first thing you'll notice won't even be inside the store; it'll be the big, plastic walnut hanging above the front doorway. That big walnut has become somewhat of a landmark item on this stretch of Bloor, even though they've only been in business for a few months.\n\nNuthouse isn't just about nuts. They carry all sorts of things, from organic candy and fair-trade coffee to raw cereals and handmade soap. And its healthy too. A lot of the stuff they carry is the sugar-free, vegan, raw, organic type of stuff, which makes it a super option for more health conscious people. And if you have dietary restrictions, Nuthouse has got you covered too with tons of gluten and wheat free products, like their spiced carrot cake. If that's your bag and you live in the area, you no longer need to travel far to get these kinda things.\n\nPersonally, when I think of organic or locally-sourced or handmade or any other related adjective used to describe stuff in a store like this, I unfortunately also think 'expensive'. At Nuthouse though, that really isn't the case. The prices are actually fairly down-to-earth and mostly afforable. In fact, a lot of the products they sell are actually cheaper than the bulk stuff you find at No Frills, with an obvious element of quality you may not find at bigger places. \n\nWanting to try out interesting varieties of stuff you already love, like lentils or rice or yes, even nuts? Nuthouse has got you covered. They carry a ton of different kinds, some of which you probably didn't even know existed. And that brings up one of the best things about buying in bulk in a place like this: you can buy in smaller amounts purely just because you want to try something. Buying in bulk doesn't have to be about being able to get more for less, it's about being able to also get, well, just less. The fact that Nuthouse just happens to make it also affordable is just the icing on the organic carrot cake.","useful":0,"funny":1,"cool":0}

It's a casual place with daily deals (movies, cheap wine on Wednesdays, etc.), TVs showing Blue Jays' games and young staff working feverishly to keep up with the sit-in and take-out clientele.  It's got a pleasant, relaxed vibe and people seemed to be rather enjoying themselves.\n\nOnce seated in our booth, we perused the menu and our lovely server explained how the restaurant works: you write down your order on the notepad provided, bring it up to the counter and hand it in. You can either pay right away or begin a tab. Any subsequent orders can be placed through the wait staff. I assume this method is effective for those in a hurry, but it did seem a little odd considering how often our server checked in on us. She also expounded upon the \"red sauce\" pizzas made with Campania tomato sauce, fior-de-latte mozzarella, basil and pecorino romano cheese. (The \"white sauce\"pizzas are made with a garlic and olive oil sauce instead of the tomatoes.)\n\nWe opted for the prosciutto-wrapped mozzarella balls for an appetizer, the funghi tartufo and San Andreas pizzas and, for dessert, the dolce and banana dish. As with any self-respecting pizza place, they had San Pellegrino on the menu so got an Aranciata (my fave) and a Limonata. My dining companion kindly took the order the counter while I scoped out the huge place before me. Famoso has really nice exposed brick walls, comfortable booths and, by my count, at least three staff members per table. There are a lot of eyes on tables and not much gets missed. The staff is universally nice, if perhaps inexperienced. It lacked a certain finesse, but made up for it in sweet charm.\n\nOur appetizer arrived and I'm glad we asked for salt, pepper and chili flakes. The mozzarella balls were tasty, but the red sauce (which would appear later on our funghi pizza) was very, very sweet. For my liking, too sweet.  A dash of salt and some chili flakes were necessary and helped considerably. I was hoping for crispier prosciutto, too; as a start to the meal, it was pretty average. If you're going to get an appetizer, I would recommend you try a salad. They looked fresh and tasty.\n\nOur funghi  tartufo pizza arrived fairly shortly afterward. It consisted of roasted white mushrooms, oyster mushrooms, truffle oil and parmiggiano reggiano.  Again, it was better with the salt and chili flakes.  The crusts at Famoso are a bit thicker than is the trend right now, but I liked the chewier texture. I only wish that this pizza had been left in the 900-degree oven a little longer as it needed a little more crispiness to counter the soft, melting cheese that was starting to soak through the crust. (A note: I took a slice of this one home and had it two days later. I have to say, it tasted much better as a leftover!)\n\nOur second pizza - the San Andreas - was a \"New World Pizza\" with a white sauce, chili-lime marinated chicken and fresh mozzarella. It was then baked and topped with avocado slices, diced roma tomatoes, onion, cilantro, a drizzle of cream and a lime wedge. Certainly not traditional, but pretty darned tasty. The pizza seemed to have stayed in the oven just that little bit longer and had that nice char on the bottom. The lime juice provided a bright flavour and the chicken was tender. (I'd have liked a little more chicken, but that's a bit of a nitpick. It was a good pizza.) Were I to go back, I would steer my companions toward it if they wanted to try something a little different.\n\nFinally, dessert. This was my favourite dish of the four we tried. A long, rectangular plate of roasted bananas coated in caramelized brown sugar, topped with pecans and caramel sauce and a scoop of ice cream in the middle arrived at the table and my eyes widened. This looked and smelled fantasti and tasted even better. The bananas were piping hot and creamy and contrasted beautifully with the crunch of the sugar and the chill of the ice cream. That dish was devoured in what had to be record time.\n\nOverall, Famoso is...fine. There isn`t anything in particular that stands out but there isn't anything egregiously wrong with it, either.  It caters to a wide variety of tastes so it is sure to be a good option if you are going out with a group with varying tastes or dietary restrictions or preferences. Do not bother with the prosciutto-wrapped mozzarella balls, but do not skip dessert.","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":0}

For such a moderately-priced Italian restaurant, they surely hold their own.\n\nI was ecstatic to find that my penne side dish with the Pollo alla Fiorentina - chicken sautéed with spinach and sun-dried tomatoes in smooth and rich cream sauce - could be replaced with tender gnocchi. I truly could eat pasta every day, but gnocchi is my new favourite indulgence. I'm on the hunt for the best in the city and will devour any potato pasta nugget that comes my way in the process.\n\nThe veal Marsala entree is adorned with tons of sautéed mushrooms, the vegetables were cut large and almost put the roasted potatoes to shame; it was true Italian comfort food.\nAnd as for the Papparedelle al Salmone, the wide threads of pasta are covered all over with a pink Salmon-infused cream sauce. Rich and smooth, this was definitely the star of our table.\n\nPersonally, I can't go to an Italian restaurant that has Tartufo on the menu and not order it - no matter how full dinner has left me. A few flavours are offered, but I finally landed on Tartufo Royale, a tart and sweet pairing of raspberry and chocolate ice creams covered in cocoa and drizzled with chocolate sauce. I also happened to snag a scoop of pistachio gelato, but it didn't hold a candle to the aforementioned chocolate indulgence.\n\nLa Passione was a nice surprise, with entrees coming in around $15-$20 and a wide-range of choices on the menu, it is sure to satisfy. They also occasionally post deals on Groupon - it makes for the perfect opportunity to get out and try something new.","useful":5,"funny":3,"cool":5}

Well no, it isn't, but that's exactly how I wanted to start this off. Man, I really wanted to love this place. La Revolucion just looks so dam cool, that I figured the whole experience was going to be amazing. When I was first drawn by the interesting front stained-glass window and poked my head inside to look around, I figured that in no-time-at-all, there'd be a lineup to get in. Sadly, I don't think that's going to be the case anytime soon.\n\nLa Revolucion is a Mexican restaurant, but at first glance, it certainly doesn't scream Mexican; after eating there, I'm not even sure that's what they're going for. It's a sparsely decorated joint that for some reason--at least while I was there--feels the need to distance themselves even more from their Mexican roots by blasting annoyingly loud rave music. I mean, their food is the typical, standard Mexican fare you'd expect, like enchiladas and tacos and burritos, but other than that and the few Mexican-esque decorations, there wasn't much Mexican about it at all.\n\nThey're heavily pushing the banditos aspect of Mexican culture, which is actually a pretty cool gimic in my eyes. While I get the whole concept of banditos and revolution, it seemed as though La Revolucion fell a little short of their delivery of the theme. While what little decor they have there is mostly bandito-related, the rest of the theme is left to interpretation. La Revolucion does feel as though they're finding their identity, but they have a lot of difficulty conveying what that identity is exactly to their guests. Sitting there, it doesn't feel as though you were part of the revolution, it feels as though you're interrupting them while they plan it, and they can't wait for you to leave so they can get back down to business.\n\nPresentation isn't their strong point either. They haphazardly slap the food down on the plate, without much concern for appearances. My enchiladas were slightly warm and covered in tasteless green salsa; my burrito was humungous, but it was bland and not nearly warm enough. When I asked for hot sauce, because it was nowhere to be found, I got a small ramekin with some sort of sauce, but it's details remained a mystery that was left for me to find out with no explanation from the server, and while you're waiting for that stuff to all arrive, there's no offer of chips and salsa or even water for that matter, which would have definitely improved the experience.\n\nInterestingly enough, before this place was a Mexican place it was, well, a Mexican place. Whoever it is that owns it probably just decided it was time to rebrand, and while that may have been a great idea on their part, the execution of their new brand and concept needs some polishing because it's hard to tell exactly what the concept is. La Revolucion may be a restaurant, but a revolution it is not.","useful":7,"funny":3,"cool":2}

Like most places owned and run by families, this restaurant is small, a bit cluttered with a mishmash of décor and, no matter the number of other patrons there at the time, has a staff that makes you feel like the centre of attention.\n\nThey happen to be closed on the weekend, but from Monday to Thursday they are open from 11:00 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. and Fridays from 11:00 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. The hours are slightly odd, but it makes for a great lunch spot, especially for those like me who tend to take lunch anytime between about noon and 3:00 p.m.\n\nThey offer a variety of chicken dishes, a number of different sides and even one vegetarian option. You can get a 1\/4 or 1\/2 rotisserie chicken dinner - white meat or dark meat - with a choice of two small sides for $6.50 - $10.00. For an additional $0.99 (small) or $1.98 (double) you can get a side of onion rings, Greek or Caesar salad.\n\nThe menu itself is pretty huge and is filled with quite a few options. The regular roster of sides, for example, includes Portuguese rice, roasted Parisian potatoes, steamed vegetables, French fries, garden salad or potato wedges. Mains include the abovementioned chicken combos, rib combos, a variety of salads and soups, chicken wings and fingers and sandwiches, like pulled chicken, grilled vegetable, grilled chicken, pork or sausage. They even offer catering.\n\nI decided upon the pulled chicken sandwich with a side of Parisian potatoes. The pulled chicken is topped with their \"famous\" hot sauce, served on a white or whole wheat Kaiser and is dressed with mayo, lettuce and tomato. All of this, with a drink, came in at about $9.\n\nOne of my all-time favourite side dishes are those lemony, roasted potatoes available at most Greek restaurants. Well, The Rotisserie House's Parisian roasted potatoes are a close second. They are red, probably from Paprika, and just a bit fiery from the restaurant's signature hot sauce. The pulled chicken sandwich was flavourful, tender and also had the same red hue from the sauce.\n\nI do enjoy spicy foods, though I am a bit of a wimp. This restaurant's hot sauce had a great kick and a good flavour, but it won't burn your mouth to the point that you can't taste anything else. This is really important, since they throw the hot sauce on their dishes, whether it's requested or not. Don't fret too much about all the spice if you're grabbing lunch and heading back to the office, you can buy a pack of gum here too!\n\nConsidering the size of this restaurant, I was quite surprised by the number of items they have on the menu. It was not overly busy when I walked in, so everything went very smoothly as far as timing and service went. The staff is extremely friendly, but very small, so I am curious to see what happens when it gets really busy. However, they seem to have it all figured out.\n\nIf I lived closer to Liberty Village, I could see this being a regular staple for me for a quick lunch, or to grab some dinner on the way home from work. The prices are reasonable, the food tastes good and it's quick and satisfying.","useful":5,"funny":0,"cool":1}

With the exception of the Firkin on Runnymede, Dark Horse has one of the biggest and best outdoor spaces in the village to drink pints, people watch or eat burgers and fries.\n\nBut, as many people have pointed out before me, the service can range anywhere from slow to crappy when you're sitting out there. While you're waiting, you may even be waiting so long for service that you'll feel compelled to go inside and get your own drinks, which causes the server to give you attitude when she eventually gets to your table, which causes you to feel uncomfortable; you see the vicious circle taking shape here...\n\nAll-in-all, the food at Dark Horse isn't half bad. Granted, they aren't going to win any awards anytime soon, but for pub food that goes well with a few drinks, it's pretty decent. While some of the food, like the calamari and nachos, is previously frozen and highly unimaginative, other items, like their Village Burger or fish and chips, are clearly made in-house and truly tasty. They also serve a weekend brunch that is worth checking out, but expect to wait for a table; it fills up quickly with the neighbourhood locals.\n\nAll of the expected draft options are here...I think. Truth-be-told, the server never actually rattled off the draft list to us in the limited time she spent at our table. Luckily, there were a few beer-branded signs in the patio, which makes the process a little easier, but a lot less convenient.\n\nDark Horse's problems are easily fixable; they just need a bit more staff. Trust me, sit back on the patio, have a pint, and watch them work. It'll quickly become obvious that they're understaffed. Another server or two during their busier times, and Dark Horse could be fantastic.\n\nTruth be told, it's just a pub, and a fairly average one at that. If you're in a hurry, you may want to avoid this place, but if you've got some time to kill and want to soak up some sun on a patio, Dark Horse provides nicely.","useful":3,"funny":2,"cool":0}

The dimly lit house-turned-restaurant with the splendidly seamy vibe immediately and completely tugged at my heart strings.  I loved the rickety setting and little details like the \"Draught: Use Your Eyes\" sign behind the bar.\n\nBut, as with any new love, first impressions can often deceive you; The Central played with my emotions.  The menu - and be warned the online menu is not what you will find when you arrive there - has so much potential and I very much wanted the food to live up to my expectations.  My party of three shared grilled calamari with side of salad greens in a light citrus dressing, followed by entrees of grilled mushroom salad with shrimp, a grilled vegetable sandwich with sweet potato fries, and a cheesesteak sandwich with Tom Yum soup, all of which (with three beers) came in at just over $60.\n\nThe menu items are not very risky, but still need to be done carefully to be successful.  As much as I wanted everything to come out perfectly, it simply did not.  First of all, the calamari was a very large serving - so far, so good.  But, in grilling it whole, the tips became overcooked and the centre remained undercooked, and there was a hint of burnt charcoal flavour.  The grilled vegetables were also overcooked, producing an all-over brown hue, making them completely lose their individuality.  The cheesesteak had the right flavour, but again, the beef was slightly overcooked and chewy.  Finally, after looking forward to trying one of the desserts in hopes for menu-redemption, like the candied strawberries or the ever-infamous deep fried Mars bars, we were told that all they had available was ice cream.  Not so impressive.\n\nWhile the main dishes and lack of desserts were disappointing, I do have to commend them on a couple of things.  All of the side dishes were on-point; the dressing on both the calamari dish, and the mushroom salad were light, flavourful and had a good citrus tang; the sweet potato fries were crispy, and came with a side of a creamy cinnamon dip that was a great alternative to regular ketchup; and the Tom Yum soup was hot, spicy, and a great choice for a chilly December night.\n\nI have decided that The Central could very well become a favourite spot of mine for drinks, and maybe appetizers, but is just not an ideal choice for a full dinner.  The venue itself is one that you should check out, and I expect it is only better when the patio is open in the summer.  If you don't want to sit in the main bar to listen to the band they have a cozy lounge space upstairs that can be rented for private parties.  Also, they clearly take pride in the beverage menu, especially the beer choices.  When we had some trouble deciding on a pint, we were offered a sample of a new label on tap called Netherworld, a Flying Monkey brew, which is similar to the popular Mill St. Tankhouse Ale.\n\nI give them an A+ for atmosphere, but only a gold star-for-effort on the menu.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":1}

And Everest is certainly dressed to impress. The restaurant feels both sexy and modern, with dark mood lighting, clean lines, comfortable and cozy booth seating, and an eclectic playlist\/DJ, depending on what night you are in. With a great view of Queen West for people watching, and MuchMusic across the street, the atmosphere, music and style of the restaurant blend in perfectly with the locals.\n\nI was very excited to try a new place with an interesting food theme, something a little different from the usual weekend dinner and drinks, and hoping to find a new \"go-to\" place for a fun and creative meal. I secured reservations before our arrival, however, we were greeted with a bit of a frosty reception, waved to an area in the front of the room, and told I could sit wherever I wanted. Unorthodox, maybe, but sit we did!\nPutting the hostesses' indifference behind us, we decided to delve straight into the wine menu, and with a little help from our server, selected the Beringer Cabernet Sauvignon Knights Valley, a California vintage from 2009 for about $40. The wine was excellent, and I found the wine menu to be well priced for the quality of wines on the list.\n\nThe dinner menu ($15-$20) presents a somewhat more challenging predicament. Filled with Tibetan and Indian dishes, along side the same old North American stand-by of pasta and sandwiches, I found myself unsure if this was a Tibetan restaurant, or your average Italian eatery all dressed up. It's not that I mind an eclectic menu, in fact I appreciate one, however when venturing out to try a new type of cuisine (in this case, Tibetan), one wants to be sure that the restaurant is absolutely committed to their craft, and have their \"specialty cuisine\" down pat. Thus, I was unsure of whether venturing into the momas (Tibetan dumplings) and sha-momo (spinach and beef), or the fettuccine alfredo was the better option.\n\nAfter some quality deliberation between the Tibet\/North America paradox, I decided to try a platter, a mix of several different Tibetan style foods, to allow myself to experience as much of the cuisine as possible. The menu seemed heavy on potatoes, stewed meats and rice, so I decided to try almost all of the above. The stewed potatoes were good, cooked just right, but tasted much like something I could make at home, no real special spice or flavour that made me feel like I was trying something exotic. The rice was cooked with raisins, which just didn't do it for me, and was a little bland.  My meal was served with steamed Tibetan vegetables (broccoli and carrots), which aside from not seeming exceptionally Tibetan to me, were surprisingly good. An interesting side note, both of our meals were served with naan bread, which really was just pita bread from my estimation. Overall, I was fairly underwhelmed by my choice. My friend ordered the butter chicken on rice with naan bread (same problem), and said that she enjoyed her meal. The butter chicken looked and tasted pretty standard to me, so that must be a good thing, but neither of us could really wrap our heads around the lack on naan bread at restaurant serving Indian food. \n\nWhile I thoroughly enjoyed Everest restaurant for its attention to the design décor and ambience, I was definitely a little disappointed with my first foray into Tibetan food. I think the next time we decide to go out for Tibetan style cuisine, we will try \"Little Tibet\" further down Queen Street.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

It's a little cafe chock-full of character and a cool, homey-sorta vibe. You know the type of place I'm talking about: mismatched plates and cutlery on the tables, Value Village-esque paintings and pictures on the walls, slightly damaged panelling on the ceiling. It sorta looks like one day someone decided: 'Well, we have a stove. Why don't we open a restaurant?' It seems random, but truthfully, it doesn't matter all that much. If anything, those details make it better and much more comfortable.\n\nThere really isn't that much for food here. They've got a couple of items that are fairly easy for the lone person working to make when the place gets busy, which it definitely does. Mostly it's just the standard pressed sandwich kind of thing. No soup, no fries, no salad, as a side anyways. The friendly guy working there told me that it's not that kinda place. He said that it's mostly a cafe and a place to drink booze.\n\nThe menu is up on a chalkboard, and like I mentioned, it mostly has pressed sandwiches, like grilled cheese with apples and Tandoori chicken stuffed Naan bread. The sandwiches certainly aren't bad, but sadly, the majority of the stuff they make seems to have been brought in with little of it made in-house, like the Naan bread. The Naan was the kinda stuff pressed and packaged somewhere distant, and then bought at some grocery retail giant. It definitely would have been better if they worked with someone local to get some truly authentic stuff. They do have quite a few baked goods too. I'm not sure if those were made in-house or not, but they look nice next to a cup of the great coffee they serve.\n\nI've seen some pictures of brunch items at Holy Oak, like eggs Benny, but based on when I was there I couldn't see that happening. Maybe they do bring someone in on the weekends to cook, but they guy working never mentioned it to me when I asked him about the food or the limited menu.\n\nI went during the week for lunch, and this little place was pretty packed. Mostly with twenty and thirty somethings in front of laptops. It seems like a pretty cool place to work for those of us that frequent coffee shops for that sorta thing, because there really isn't much else in the neighborhood that offers it. It's cozy and comfortable, and I could easily see myself sitting there with a coffee, comfortably typing away.\n\nHoly Cafe is a neat place, but it certainly doesn't warrant a big trip to get to it. If you happen to be in the neighborhood and you're looking for a comfortable place to soak up WiFi and get a decent cup of coffee, Holy Oak can definitely provide. But it doesn't offer much more than that.","useful":5,"funny":1,"cool":3}

I mean, I know the restaurant options in Bloor West Village are limited, but I really have no idea how that place hung on for as long as it did. With horrible service, brutal food, and staff that spent more time admiring themselves in the mirror than their customers, they created a place that was meant to be avoided. Yet somehow, it managed to exist on that corner for years.\n\nSo, imagine my surprise when I saw the beautiful sight of a building permit and brown construction paper covering their windows one day...\n\nA few months later, The Kennedy Public House was born. And boy-oh-boy, this place is exactly what  BWV needs. BWV is virtually void of restaurants serving great food. Ok, so there's earth and Dr. Generosity, but other than that, your choices are pretty limited compared to the tons of options available to other Toronto neighbourhoods. That's why seeing something as untraditional in BWV as The Kennedy is such a welcoming sight.\n\nThe Kennedy has a cool vibe that, if you know the neighbourhood, you wouldn't expect to see there. It seems oddly out-of-place while at the same time seems oddly comfortable being there. With a laboriously nice interior space, the entire design is well-thought out a nice to be in. But surprisingly, The Kennedy isn't just nice to look at; it also has exceptionally good food.\n\nThe Kennedy's menu doesn't serve your typical pub grub; it's much more imaginative than that. Non-traditional items, like polenta burgers, calamari po'boy sandwiches, and pork belly casoulet easily compliment more traditional pub fare, like wings, macaroni and cheese, and thin crust pizzas. Their menu does a fantastic job of covering everyone while still remaining concise and well-thought out.\nWorking with a number of local businesses, the Kennedy also proudly sources bread and meats from places you're probably familiar with, like Cobs bread and Wellington County Beef. Nice. I've always found that knowing where the food comes from somehow makes it taste better.\n\nOne other thing worth mentioning: The Kennedy has unisex bathrooms. And they've incorporated them into the place really nicely, except for the hand-dryer. The bathroom hand-dryer must be the loudest dam one in the entire free-world. If you happen to be sitting in the back-half of the restaurant, it might even ruin your experience. Hopefully they'll turn to either cloth or paper towels, or they'll just find one that is quieter.\n\nKeep in mind though, if you're looking for a relaxing experience, this isn't the place. With strollers and screaming babies during the day that makes it resemble a Montesorri school, and lineups and loud music in the evening that makes it resemble something at John and Adelaide, The Kennedy doesn't provide a quite and relaxing experience; what they do provide is a killer take on the food you wouldn't expect to find in a typical public house.","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":1}

An easy walk from the Rosedale subway stop, we went the evening of the Stanley Cup final, expecting the place to be packed, but managed to find comfortable high-top seating, and friendly service, amidst a fairly busy night.\n\nThe Rebel House is a small pub, with a quaint upstairs section, where we sat. Several TV's aired the hockey game, and there was an eclectic mix of people, some older, into their 50's, but predominantly a mix of twenty and thirtysomething young professionals and students.\n\nThe menu is varied, but small, although they offer a revolving door of several daily specials that seem to be based on season and availability, which is always a good bet.\n\nMy dining partner decided to go with the daily special Mussels ($14), absolutely delicious in a white wine and garlic sauce, with toasted garlic bread. I ordered the Spicy Spinach Cheese Pennies ($10), small appetizer-sized cheese patties, with nary a spinach leaf in sight...nor were they spicey. No matter. These delightful little morsels were crispy on the outside, gooey on the inside, and came with a delectable tomato chutney and sour cream to top with. At our server's suggestions, I also ordered the Spinach and Apple Salad ($6), with cheddar cheese, toasted almonds, and a homemade maple dressing on the side. A wonderful combination. In fact, we liked the cheese pennies so much, we ordered another batch, only to find that that a repeat order isn't always as good the second time around. These pennies were so thick with grease, I found myself soaking up the oil slick with a napkin just to get them down. I think ordering a third time might have settled this dilemma for good, but for now I choose to remember the experience based on my initial encounter with the Spicy Spinach Cheese Pennies; delightful.\n\nMy dining partner, an \"adventurous\" drinker himself, ordered a Labatt Blue, but it did come in the extra large bottle, which made him smile from ear to ear. I ordered the Henry of Pelham Pinot Noir to start, but must admit that it tasted watered down and a bit weak. Not to be discouraged, I tried the 2006 Cabernet Franc Special Reserve VQA after dinner, and was pleasantly surprised by one of the nicer glasses of wine I have had at a pub in some time. It had a heavy quality, with a nice vanilla finish. I would go back to Rebel House just to try this glass of wine again.\n\nOur server was friendly and talkative, and the prices at Rebel House are fairly reasonable. Wine was about $7-$8 a glass, and our meals were between $8-$12 for the appetizers, and up to $20 for an entrée. Except for the bad experience with the second order of cheese pennies, Rebel House is an excellent neighbourhood pub, serving up good food at good prices.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1}

In a desperate attempt to finally darken the doorway of Hey Lucy, I was disheartened to find that going right after work is not nearly early enough to snag a table for cheap martini Wednesday at that popular King West spot. Enter stage-right, Ultimate Café (a bit of Entertainment District fun for you there). Whether coincidentally or strategically, they also offer their own cheap martini Wednesday - how clever. \n\nTheir menu is fairly standard, including soups, nachos, sandwiches and Paninis, pastas and salads and they say the ingredients are bought fresh daily from Kensington Market.\n\nAfter my first meal, I decided to do some reading and collect the thoughts from others before making my final decision on Ultimate. The reviews are mixed, and I have to agree with that sentiment.\n\nI've now been to Ultimate twice, once for dinner and once for lunch. The night of the martinis, I decided to make a meal of appetizers - a favourite thing to do. I had the spring rolls and the sweet potato and lemongrass soup. I wasn't disappointed in the least; the spring rolls were crunchy and hot and the soup, though a tad too sweet for my own taste (always a risk for sweet potato dishes), was flavourful, thick and rich. It was a satisfying meal but, much like the menu, was basic stuff.\n\nThen, I went back for lunch. \n\nWe started with the nachos which turned out to be a delight. They look completely unimpressive, but once you dive in you'll realize that there is just the right amount of melted cheese, neither scorched or soggy, and it's topped lightly with chopped lettuce, tomato, olives and jalapeno. I have come across some online grumbles about the portion sizes, but any more and it would have proven far too big for a two-person starter or a one-person meal. My entrée was the Montreal smoked meat Panini with a side salad. The Panini was my favourite dish there by far. The meat was warm and tender and, again, was not over-sized. The sandwich was obviously freshly pressed and there was a tangy mustard spread topping it off. But, here's the rub - the salad was small and the leaves were wilted, which is a common complaint across the boards about their greens and the dressing could not possibly have been made in-house. It maybe could have passed for garnish. A really top-notch side could have elevated this dish to be lunch-time excellence. Like the portions, the prices are decent, with both of my visits coming in at just around $20 per person\n\nThere is one very short footnote-type comment that I must leave you with. On both occasions I was greeted by an employee whom I can only assume is the host. He will nab you on the street when you stop to glance at the menu to convince you to come in and, though he means well, will be extremely present during your time there. I can't say it was bothersome enough to warrant a phone call, but I also cannot give you my recommendation without mentioning this very obvious addition to the dining experience at Ultimate. \n\nSo, I toyed with a 2-star vs. my decided upon 3-star rating. The decor is kind of cool, the service was fast and courteous, despite the over-attentive host and we were seated in no time on a busy night. They offer some pretty good, if not somewhat lack-lustre grub, with at least one amazing sandwich. \n\nJust doors down from the previously reviewed Joe Mamas, King West is turning out to be a favourite food stop for me.","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":0}

Kent is just one of a series of 'Duke Pubs' scattered around Toronto, and judging from the fairly comprehensive website, each has a slightly different décor, but all of them seem to tap into that English corner pub ambience.\n\nAfter a long week at work, I was on the hunt for a casual space to grab a pint, enjoy some hearty food, and catch up with some friends; the Duke of Kent was a great choice...for the most part.\n\nI snagged a corner booth with my dinner group on a busy Friday night.  When we first walked in, it seemed hopeless. We wanted dinner, but there was nary a table to be seen.  The staff did everything they could to make a space for us so we weren't forced back out into the cold to one of the other countless restaurants in the area.  That is what service is all about, and we were happy to stay.  Many thanks to the serving staff for being so accommodating on a hopping Friday night!\n\nAs for the food, it is the expected and welcomed pub spread.  They offer up fish & chips (yes, served in a basket on paper), pot roast and potatoes with buttered peas, and even bangers and mash.  You will find an array of reasonably priced English pub food on the menu, with entrees coming in at about $12 across the board.\n\nAs I've said before, I tend to go for the specials, and that night it was Moroccan Stew.  Unfortunately, I am sad to say it was disappointing.  The dish was somewhere between a curry and a Mexican chili, and I was given a healthy serving for the $12.99 price-point.  But, I couldn't help but become envious of those around me who had gravy-topped pot pies, crispy fish and chips, beefy burgers and gooey quesadillas.  I probably would not have been as put-off by the it if it was labelled on the menu, as it was on my bill - just 'vegetable stew'.  It was not as exotic as the name lead me to believe, and with a delicious-looking curry dish on the main menu, I expected more spice and life in my 'Moroccan' Stew special.\n\nFor a visit to the Duke, I suggest going full-English.  I saw enough plates of fish and chips go by to convince me that it is a popular item, and how much more traditional can you get than that?  Also, I have the 'famous' deep-fried pepperoni targeted - it has to be famous for a reason!\n\nAt the end of it all, the Duke of Kent draws in a wonderfully lively crowd, and provides a great atmosphere and service, albeit a bit slow - but hey, it was busy!  My food may have only been so-so, but the brew was cold, and my night was great.","useful":3,"funny":1,"cool":2}

The entrance way is virtually non-existent, and stepping through the front door immediately plunges you into the middle of the usually busy and oddly laid out dining room. At the back, a long wooden bar--the type you'd feel comfortable seeing in a Boston Pizza--eclipses the view entirely. The bar is far too big, and completely takes away from the Indian experience, and the only décor to be found is some dated Indian travel posters and a few paintings themed of elephants and palm trees. But trust me, it doesn't matter in the slightest. You likely won't even notice. Why? Because this place churns out some seriously outstanding Indian food that would be just as good if it was served on a picnic table in the neighbouring Christie Pits Park.\n\nSavoury and creamy butter chicken, seasoned and spiced chicken masala, bright and soft saffron rice; all of the items you'd expect to see on an Indian menu are here. I've been here a few times, and my opinion is that the best way to order is to share, especially if your experience with Indian food is limited. Ordering a few samosas (meat patties) and cauliflower pakoras (chickpea battered cauliflower), and some peas pulao (flavoured basmati rice), a bowl of chicken masala (chicken with yogourt and spices), a bowl of fish curry (masala spiced-salmon) and a plate of naan bread (Tandoori-fried bread) for example, allows you to try a lot of different things, and can be more than enough to accommodate upwards of 6 people.\n\nNow, I don't want to just casually mention the naan bread like that. I'd be doing it a profound injustice. It is absolutely to-die-for beyond good. It is never made ahead of time; it's made right when you order it. It's soft, cooked perfectly, and has a slight charcoal flavour from being expertly cooked in the tandoor. I've stopped in before just to pick up a few pieces of naan and nothing else. If you're there, definitely order it.\n\nPleasantly enough, this place is never at a loss for staff. Any evening you decide to go, you're sure to be taken care of. One of the things--and I cant believe I'm saying this--is that this place may actually be overstaffed. I've gone there before and felt as if I may have been the server's only table, despite being a packed house. It's a true joy to experience.\n\nI know I said that the ugly bar and awkward entrance-way don't matter, and they don't for me. But if you're after more than just amazing Indian food, like say, an authentic setting and traditionally dressed staff, then you may want to keep looking; you won't find that here. What you will find is skillfully cooked, delicious food served to you by exceptionally attentive, friendly staff.","useful":8,"funny":1,"cool":2}

It might be a little too unassuming for its own good, as many people seemed to question its whereabouts when I mentioned its name...but maybe Bar Salumi doesn't like the spotlight.  Indeed, its sign is almost an afterthought, with the store's original signage for an antique shop, dominating the storefront.\n\nMy friend and I had been meaning to go ever since she discovered they served Burrata pizza.  She really has a thing for that cheese, and I can't say I blame her. It's delicious.  We went awhile back, excited at the prospect of this new twist on a Margharita pie, only to find out the chef was on vacation and they were only serving up the liquid portion of their menu.  Normally I wouldn't have a problem with this, and in some cases I would actually prefer it, but that night we were hungry and consequently, deflated. My friend entered the chefs ETA in her phone, and we vowed to return.\n\nTwo weeks later, the alarm sounded, reminding us that the chef was back to work (and also that she had golden potatoes ready to harvest in Smurf Village).  We went the very next day.\n\nAs it was on our previous visit, Bar Salumi was quiet and dark, illuminated by flickering chandeliers (leftovers from the former antique shop maybe?) and tea light candles housed within mason jars.  Hanging legs of prosciutto fight for space with ceiling fans, and a boar's head watches diners from high above on the back wall.  I know it might not sound like it (what with the strong presence of dangling cured meat and taxidermy) but it has a real romantic vibe happening.\n\nThere is no kitchen at Bar Salumi, so our personable apron-clad server was also our chef.  The menu is a small one, focused on pizza and apps, so diners can watch as everything is prepared behind the bar. It did get a bit hot, what with the pizza oven operating from within the same room, but think how cozy that would be on a winter's night.\n\nThe menu is presented on the wall in cafeteria style (or bowling alley) fashion, with those little plastic letters that slide in and out, and I half expected to see nachos and cheese listed somewhere.  More menus were brought to us on mini clipboards, and because the food menu was unnecessary as we had fully rehearsed our order, we paused awhile over the drink list.  They offer a thoughtful selection of reds and whites as well as some interesting cocktails.  We went with two glasses of Malbec ($12 each) to go with our starter of olives & nodini with ricotta salata ($4).  So far so good, except that I couldn't help but think the nodini crackers weren't the most functional choice for the cheese...more like basketball hoops for the olives.\n\nOur pizza ($14), although not wood-fired, did come served on a cross-section of a tree trunk.  With the creamy white Burrata blending with the red of the San Marzano tomatoes, punctuated by basil it was like an homage to the Italian flag.  I wish I could say that the Burrata we were so looking forward to, made it the penultimate Margharita experience, but it was like any other made with Bufala.  The two are from the same family after all, so I'm not sure what we were thinking.  Cheese does things to people.  That being said however, we weren't disappointed, as the sauce was tangy, the crust was crispy, and it was big enough for both of us to eat and still take home leftovers.\n\nI wouldn't rank the pizza with the likes of pie giants, Terroni or Libretto, but Bar Salumi is rife with ambience where the aforementioned aren't.  The promise of Buratta may have lured me in the first time, but it's the character that will bring me back.","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":1}

Walking into Hey Meatball! instantly feels like you are walking into your old high school cafeteria. A few two and four person tables are set up, and there's one long 16 person table down the middle, all this in a space that was clearly not built for this many diners. I wasn't entirely sure if we were to seat ourselves or wait for direction. We inquired with the cashier\/order taker\/owner to find out. I know he was the owner because he told us.\n\nFor a restaurant that serves all meatballs, all the time, we were surprised to find that there were only three entrée selections on the chalk board and a few side dishes to choose from. Of the four side dishes, two had already been crossed out for the day, leaving a side salad or butternut squash soup. I decided to order the vegetarian eggplant 'meatballs' with polenta and parmesan, and my dining partner ordered the Porky  meatballs, (a combination of pork and ground beef) with tomato sauce on spaghetti. Immediately I was told that they were out of polenta and was asked \"what would I like it on?\" Unsure of my options, even after asking, I replied with \"spaghetti,\" as that was the only thing on the chalkboard that I was sure that they had in stock.\n\nWe each ordered a homemade cream soda, we were given a number, and we took a seat. Our number was called out about 10 minutes later, and we immediately noticed the disparity in portion size. My eggplant 'meatballs' were served on a huge swirl of very al dente spaghetti, whereas the porky meatballs arrived on what could be considered an order from the children's menu- if there was one that is.\n\nThe food was good, but not great. The eggplant 'meatballs' had a nice consistency, and were spicy and full of flavor. The tomato sauce that the dish was served with was hearty and not too salty, however I thought that the pasta could have been cooked a little more. The Porky meatballs were excellent, the combination of pork and beef proved to be a hit, however we both found that the tomato sauce served with the meatballs was far too sweet for the savory nature of the dish.\n\nThe saving grace of the meal was the amazing cream sodas they make fresh on site. They were a throwback to the Jones cream soda that you used to drink as a kid, but without too much fizz. Unfortunately, when the beverage you order to go with your meal is the best part of the experience, you know that there is something missing.\n\nHey Meatball! is missing the warm and friendly atmosphere you would expect to find in a restaurant with a wide open kitchen, communal tables and a chef that endeavors to use ingredients within a 100-mile radius of Toronto. All great qualities to have in a unique restaurant with a unique concept, but here, it just didn't seem to create anything memorable. There was no music playing while we were in, and the gruff reception and fluorescent lighting that made it a little harsh on the eyes made Hey Meatball! mostly a letdown.","useful":5,"funny":1,"cool":2}

Craft beers, slightly pretentious menu and crowd, its Junction location (sigh, I remember the days when they avoided this area). And although I spend quite a bit of time in the neighbourhood, I only managed to getting around to checking it out a few days ago. That's mostly because it's a difficult place to notice, with an unassuming, simple '3030 stenciled on the front door, and not much else to identify it.\n\n3030 is huge inside... seriously huge; especially for a place in The Junction. Stuffed full of small table settings and 2 full bars, it seems more like you're in a concert hall than a neighbourhood restaurant, and that's with good intention. 3030 is built to be a live music venue that doubles as a food-venue, and in my opinion, not the other way around (although that's what they go for in the off hours).\n\nOne thing's for sure, they put a lot of thought into their draft selection. The back bar has taps full of local-ish craft brews, including Wellington, Beaus, and even some other, more difficult one's to find, like the Junction Craft Brewing's IPA (which was fantastic), a Sawdust City stout, and a Broadhead White. Clearly, they take their beer selection very seriously. The unfortunate thing about the bars though is that with no stools to sit on, you get the distinct that they don't want you hanging out there.\n\nMuch like you'd expect from a place aimed at young-pros in The Junction (sigh), the atmosphere sets it up as a pretty cool place to hang out, with shelves full of board games and walls lined with old-school pinball machines and plenty of interesting art. With the retro pinball machines all lit up in the evening, it gives the perfect backdrop to a night out.\n\nBut with just a little '5 dollar snack menu' card on each table, you wonder what about those of us that were there for more than snacks. Our server haphazardly and unconfidently rattled off the items they serve (there was only 4 of them at the time) but not before having to go back to the kitchen a couple of times before she could get it right. I asked if the items changed daily, hence no menus and the difficulty remembering them, but nope, these items had been here for a while she said. While it's cool to try items out to see what works, I hope that eventually they'll put together a more permanent and more expansive menu, or at least one that changes seasonally.\n\nBecause none of their mains sounded appealing to us, we instead opted for the items on the snack menu. The Butter Chicken Wings, while mostly tasty with the typical strong flavours you'd expect, arrived lukewarm. The Potato Wedges on the other hand, were indescribably and inedibly  hot, which turned out to be ok because they were bland and tasteless anyways. Overall, we just didn't find any of the items on the snack menu impressive at all.\n\nIf you're in the neighbourhood, 3030 may be worth checking out, but I'd say solely for their draft selection; and although the fact that there isn't much like it in the neighbourhood makes it the kind of place you want to check out, I'd wait until there is a concert or show you want to see before making the trek. In my opinion, it just isn't worth going out of your way for.\n\nWith a Gabby's now opened next door, I remember feeling a little upset for them having competition so close from some evil, corporate chain, but really, it's of little consequence. It's obvious right away that they'll both be attracting very different types of people.","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":1}

In fact, Buster's Sea Cove isn't even in the same boat. At Buster's, you won't find soft lighting, romantic ambience, or table-side service, but what you're pretty much guaranteed to find, is some killer seafood served up really, really quickly.\n\nFresh-made fish and chips are the staple in this place, but they've got so much more than that. Their huge menu has everything from crab cakes and clam strips to fried oysters and fish-topped salads. And their fish-type sandwiches, something that they happen to do really, really well, are outstanding. I'm not talking about your standard old fried-fish-on-a-bun here; Buster's rivals the best seafood takeout places with crab cake paninis and seared tuna melts sandwiches.\n\nBut don't overlook the fish and chips either. This little takeout stand easily delivers one of the best plates of the stuff in the city. They've got a few varieties of fish to choose from, and each of them is served up expertly battered and crispy. Each plate of fish and chips also comes with in-house made fries and a killer slaw.\n\nBuster's also has a few other options you wouldn't expect from a takeout stand. Grilled swordfish, seafood bisque, rainbow trout, even octopus to name a few. It ain't fine dining by any means, but they truly do push the limits of what takeout is both in quality and selection.\n\nChances are though, once you get your food you'll be spending most of your time searching for a place to eat it. Busters only has 4 tables or so scattered around in front of the counter, but if those are full-and they probably will be-you're on your own. There's an exit close by to the Market's back patio and parking lot where most of Buster's customers end up, but trust me, if it's a nice day out, that'll fill up pretty quick too and you'll be left looking for a place to eat your by-then-getting-cold food.\n\nTruth be told though, even if you're standing out back of the market among parked cars and alleyways, it won't matter all that much. You might not even notice. Whether it's a crab cake sandwich or plate of fish and chips, the food at Buster's is just that dam good.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":1}

You can walk in to place your order or call ahead for pick up or delivery; they add a reasonable $3.00 delivery charge for the area nearby and $5.00 + for further surrounding areas, depending on the distance. If you call with special requests or large party orders, the chefs will accommodate you in a very timely manner - if it's not on the menu, just ask!\n\nJust like the fish, the interior is raw. There is actually one very small table with some chairs around it by the front window, but I've never seen anyone sitting there. There's a display that sits just to the left when you walk in, covered with bags of Japanese snacks for purchase and, on your right, you'll find shelves filled with a few groceries; dried sheets of nori is one recognizable item that jumps out immediately.\n\nChef John Lee has been serving up fresh and beautiful sushi platters at this location since 2005. It is impressive to note that he worked under the iron chef himself, Morimoto. There is something soothing about the fact that they prepare your food behind the counter in full view. It's that commitment to preparing and presenting the freshest ingredients that has built their dedicated customer base.\n\nLunch combos range from $15 to $25 and dinner combos from $15 to $35. If you choose the sashimi - individual pieces of raw fish with no rice - it does bring the price up a bit, but it's well worth it for something so delectable. If ordering a la carte is more your style, there are unique rolls to choose from, including: nigiri sushi (fish on rice), small rolls, inside out rolls and special rolls with everything from eel to sea urchin to marinated dried pumpkin.\n\nOur dinner for two was easily fulfilled with the vegetable sushi combo, which includes miso soup, and adding one Una Tekkyu roll (eel, tuna, cucumber, fish roe) and, my sushi must, an order of edamame. The vegetable rolls are prepped delicately to appear as if they too are made with tender slices of fish, the cucumber rolls are a refreshing addition and there is even a roll with an orange, crunchy vegetable called Burdock - carrot-like in appearance and texture, but with a different and unique flavour.\n\nTheir fresh ingredients are really the highlight. Nori can easily become chewy and tough, but Marche's is tender and graces the palate without even a hint of the unappealing sea-scent that you might get from a lesser sushi establishment. I have to say I'm not the biggest fan of the cold edamame they serve, but I wouldn't want to trek my raw fish home with something steaming hot resting on top of it anyway, so I don't mind this one pre-prepared item.\n\nIf your only sushi experience is picking up a pack of that generic grocery store stuff, with the fake green grass insert, Sushi Marche is really the place to discover all the glory of raw fish.","useful":4,"funny":2,"cool":1}

Weekends however, draw a big crowd and my nine-to-five job prevented me from going during the week and avoiding said crowd.  Fortunately, having resigned from my job to be a writer (see: unemployed) I am now afforded the luxury of going to brunch on say, a Tuesday...which is exactly what I did this week.\n\nI love Mitzi's location.  Tucked away on a quiet corner of Sorauren, surrounded by century homes, purple and yellow painted Mitzi's is a bit out-of-place, but that's the appeal.  I have a thing for old neighbourhood general stores, and that's what Mitzi's reminds me of.  Inside looked exactly how I both expected and hoped for; arborite tables with mismatched chairs, a glass display case that housed trays of muffins at the time, and walls adorned with local art.  I really, really wanted to like this place.\n\nAnd like it I did, however my friend was less than satisfied with her experience.  Let's start with mine shall we?  Mitzi's has a small but thoughtful menu, and I had previously perused it online, so I knew exactly what I wanted.  Craving sweet over savoury, I ordered the French toast as planned ($10.95).  Made with Challah bread it is then topped with a peach & ginger compote, covered in graham cracker crumbs and generously doused with real maple syrup (the last step done by yours truly).  It was fantastic.  The bread was thick and fluffy, and the compote had just the right amount of ginger in it.  It had all the makings of a dessert...in a breakfast.  It should be noted that this dish is typically served with whipped cream, but I decided it was too much of an indulgence (says the person who used so much syrup as to make her French toast wish it had signed up for swimming lessons).\n\nSitting just adjacent to the expanding pool of syrup, but not completely out of its reach, were the home fries, which offset the sweetness of the French toast nicely.  Made with halved baby potatoes they were spiced perfectly.  My only complaint is that there weren't more of them, but it's probably for the best in the long run.  If the toast itself was the star of the show, then the home fries were the understudy.\n\nAs I had already had my morning coffee I chased all of this with a glass of their homemade orange\/banana\/mango juice.  It was just thick enough to know it was the real thing, and at $3 I think it was good value.\n\nThe glowing endorsement ends with my friends order.  She was so looking forward to her poached eggs (also $10.95).  Served on Portuguese cornbread, topped with wilted spinach,  and slathered in roasted red pepper & asiago sauce, it looked delicious when set down in front of her, but as she cut into the egg with her fork, the yolk failed to flow.  Her poached eggs weren't poached at all... they were hard-boiled.  Cue the violins. Tasty yes, but it wasn't what she wanted, and the accompanying rye bread would fail to serve its dipping duty.\n\nThis would have been a 4 star review had I made it a solo trip, but alas the poached eggs (or lack thereof) knocked it down a peg.  Mitzi's is still worth a visit though for the French toast (and I hear the Oatmeal Buttermilk Pancakes are pretty killer too), but if it's poached eggs you crave, be specific,...if only for the sake of your toast and its reason for being.","useful":2,"funny":2,"cool":1}

New to the neighbourhood, but not new to the restaurant scene, Paese has been operating out of their Bathurst street location since 1989.  Serving up Italian comfort food in a casual but sleek atmosphere, Paese might give longtime district resident Kit Kat some competition.\n\nWith a monochromatic colour scheme, butcher block tables and exposed brick, Paese is very welcoming, even for someone who happened to be dining alone (see: yours truly).\n\nMy server brought the customary bread to the table...but this was no ordinary bread and oil. The bread itself was warm and chewy with a pretzel like flavour.  It came with an olive, rosemary and thyme tapenade that was rich and salty.  I tried to stop after one slice, but failed miserably.  I managed to leave one out of the four slices on the plate but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't staring at it longingly throughout dinner.\n\nNext, came my Beet Caprese Salad ($13).  Grilled beets came topped with a generous portion of mozzarella di bufala, drizzled with pistachio pesto and sprinkled with pomegranate seeds.  The combination of flavours and textures worked well together, and it was just a very fresh salad overall. If seasons were characterized by salads this one would be spring.  It was filling enough to be my main course, but I wasn't done yet.\n\nAs full of bread and beets as I was, I couldn't wait for my cavatelli ($13).  Hand rolled and made with semolina it had a texture similar to gnocchi but it wasn't as filling.  The sauce was reminiscent of my grandmothers, and that's a compliment as although she wasn't Italian, she was married to one and had learned a thing or two over the years.\n\nI had initially sent away the wine menu, although I'm not sure why exactly.  Maybe it was an unexpected burst of responsibility on my part as it was a weekday afternoon and I had another review to do...but those are hardly excuses not to partake.  It's part of the job after all.  Either way, one of the resident sommeliers saw right through me and insisted on returning the wine menu to my table.  Smart man.\n\nPaese has an extensive wine list and while most can only be purchased by the bottle, they do have a comprehensive list that is sold by the glass.  Now I'm no expert on wine, but I do drink a lot of the stuff so I know what I like, and I like Amarone.  I was given a sample of a 2004 Fumanelli Amarone before committing to a full glass, after which I gave the go ahead for my server to fill 'er up.  Rich and full-bodied it was a great complement to my meal, but as far as I'm concerned it would be a great complement to anything...cheese, pasta, breakfast...\n\nBecause of its location, I probably won't make a repeat visit but I don't think Paese is having a hard time attracting other customers.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants to have a good and affordable meal with some vino before or after catching a show.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I asked if they could put some sattelite radio on, and I was told not to worry because a DJ was going to be playing soon. I left at 1030, and I never saw or heard a DJ, just Leon's, Loblaw's, and car commercials at full volume.\n\nIt does seem as though they rushed to open, and they probably could have used another week or two to get things together, but once they get it all worked out, this place stands a great chance at becoming the perfect neighbourhood hangout.\n\n*We plan to review again in two months.","useful":6,"funny":1,"cool":2}

Pachuco opened its doors on Friday, January 13th, perhaps a sign of bad luck, but that shouldn't hinder their success.\n\nPachuco is a small (read: reservations) and cozy space, with exposed brick walls, wrought-iron décor and, and a pretty impressive wall of wine bottles lit by a neon sign. Even though Pachuco shares a kitchen with older brother and Danforth favourite  Embrujo Flamenco, they definitely serve up their own distinctive flavour.\nTheir menu is well thought out and varied, with an excellent selection of meat, fish and vegetarian dishes. Their appetizer menu alone is worth the trip. With a confident boasting of guacamole flavours, including goat cheese, blue cheese, smoked trout and walnut, and a guacamole sampler patter that allows you to try three of their creations, there is seemingly no end to the interesting flavour combinations. We decided to stick to our guns, however, and go with the traditional guacamole, which was a stellar choice; lots of lime, onion and creamy avocado, but with no flavour left too overpowering. Their homemade tortilla chips have to be mentioned as well: crisp and tasty. I am hoping they will one day provide these in a to-go bag for purchase before you leave. We also ordered the Chile poblana, swathed in an excellent and perfectly spicy tomato sauce, with queso fresco and refried beans, all baked perfectly. The portion size on both entrees was more than enough for two people, and it could easily serve as a great entrée.\n\nFor our meals (both $15) we went with the Taquitos de Machaca (coffee and ancho braised beef brisket, with guacamole and honey chipotle salsa), and the pre-Hispanic delicacy of Taquitos de Huitlacoche (corn truffle, onions, jalapeño peppers, Cazuela beans served with requesón-avocado salsa). Where to start? Let's save the most interesting for last. The braised beef was well cooked and well spiced, the chipotle salsa was a great added touch, and one order of beans and rice between the two of us was more than enough to share. In fact, we both left incredibly full. Their fresh-this-second corn tortillas are amazing, sweet, soft and still warm from the press, prepared just the way you would expect to find them in a traditional Mexican eatery. The Huitlacoche, however, was an adventure in and of itself. \n\nFor those who don't know (myself included), Huitlacoche is a fungus, which grows naturally on corn in damp environments. The fungus is harvested and has been consumed as a delicacy for centuries in Central and South America cuisine. When it arrived, it tasted smokey and earthy; it looked like a dark mash of black corn, onion- and was that a jalapeño in there? Hard to tell. The dish was good, but I can't say I would strongly recommend it. Overall, I found the food at Pachuco's to be mostly over-salted, and the Huitlacoche had to be the worst offender. This is the main reason why I would not order it again; although the flavour was very different from any other Mexican dishes I have tried, and I actually did enjoy it, I just could not get over the intensity of the salt. \n\nThe drinks and food at Pachuco's ranged from good to very good, and if they could tone down the salt (margaritas included), I would probably rate most of it as excellent. However, I cannot say our overall experience was excellent, but I would not fault them for it in my overall rating. Being that it was their opening weekend, one expects a few hiccups, and I am sure they will be cleared up by the time you visit. I was served the wrong meal at first, and we had to wait about 10 to 15 minutes for the Huitlacoche to be prepared, instead of the fish tacos, (though delightful looking), I was initially served. By the time my dish came around, the other half of our meal was cold. Our side plates and used cutlery were never removed from our table after we finished with our appetizers, and the tables are so small and cramped as it is, there was no room for our mains. Instead of removing our side plates, there was a vain attempt to stuff everything on the table. I eventually had to ask for fresh cutlery and removal of the used dishes from our table. Not once, but twice, we almost had our not-quite-finished drinks taken from us, and we had to ask a few times for extra tortillas. It seemed a little strange to me that you would only get four at a time, and as great as they were, they are very, very small, so I imagine each meal would require a minimum of 3 or 4 on its own. \n\nOverall, I think these are minor complaints, especially since it was Pachuco's opening preview. I found that the service was friendly and genuine, the restaurant was quaint and ambient, with Latin music, candles and a few kitschy décor details, which made it seem authentic and allow it to live up to it's self-proclaimed 'Modern Mexican' dining experience.","useful":4,"funny":0,"cool":1}

I actually went out of my way to go to this place one day when I was craving some good-ole-fashioned-BBQ. Claiming to be serving it up in true Southern-style, I thought that there's no way this could go wrong. I've actually been to Texas and all throughout the Southern states on a fairly serious eating vacation, and lemme tell you something, The Drake and their lil' BBQ place owe the great state of Texas and its surrounding neighbours a serious apology...\n\nDrake BBQ has a slew of great reviews all over the Internet. Everyone on Yelp, Twitter, and a bunch of TO food mags have been raving about the authentic, bad-ass Texas and Carolina style BBQ they've had in this place. I've read so many good comments, that I figured I must have gone to the wrong place. Maybe, I thought, there was some other place that just happens to look exactly the same, on the exact same street, with the exact same type of food?\n\nNope... I was in the right place. It just sucked is all.\n\nBecause they have such a loyal following, I'm sure quite a few people are going to dislike what I'm saying here, but in all honesty, if you got served what I did, you'd be disappointed too. My Carolina pulled-pork sandwich was small, dry, and amazingly enough, was completey void of BBQ sauce, which is a fairly important staple in a pulled-pork sandwich. They must have had some BBQ sauce somewhere in there, but if they did, they didn't offer it to me, and it certainly wasn't on my sandwich. My coleslaw was even worse. It was incredibly bland and wasn't much more than shredded cabbage with a slight trace of what I assume was salad dressing. Not to mention that this stuff was expensive! Two of those sandwiches and an itty-bitty coleslaw-plus tip of course-cost over 20 bucks.\n\nWelcome to The Drake BBQ; it's BBQ with a side of pretentiousness. You don't like it? Trust me. If it's the same guy working behind the counter when I was there, then he won't care at all. I asked if we could get some fries with our sandwiches. he just looked at me, shocked, and said, 'I don't want a deep-fryer in this place'. Hey, I'm fine with the guy being pretentious and true to the stuff he's making and how he's making it, especially if it's honest-to-goodness Southern-style BBQ. If he truly was an artisan of the BBQ and the smoker, he can rightfully be as pretentious as he wants as far as I'm concerned. I probably would have answered back with an agreeing 'Yes Sir'! But the true kick-in-the-ass was that the stuff that I ended up taking home in a sad little brown bag was basically less than edible. In fact, I only took a few bites and ended up throwing it out, which is something I never, ever do. Someone went and filled thsi guy's head with the thought that this is actually what good BBQ is all about; someone lied to him.\n\nBesides being about honest and delicious BBQ, the Southern states are all about hospitality and genuine people; people that would never be rude or unwelcoming. They're more likely to invite you in for dinner than they are to turn you away. Drake BBQ was none of those things. The service was rude, inhospitable, and unwelcoming. From the moment I walked in, I felt as though they wanted me the hell outta there. That is, except for the older guy that handed me the bag. He sent me off with a sincere sounding 'thanks for your business', which is something I think businesses don't say enough these days.\n\nLike I said, this was painful for me. I felt ripped off. I felt sad. I felt let down. It was a just a plain bad experience that was nothing close to true Southern BBQ or Southern hospitality. In fact, I don't think I would even give it another go, and whether you've been exposed to true Southern BBQ or not, I'd suggest you don't either, because you'll feel let down either way too.","useful":4,"funny":2,"cool":1}

And it's easy to see why. Not only does it allow you to try more things on the menu, but it's also perfect for when you're  with a larger group. And that is just the reason why a couple of my friends and I headed to the Ossington area to try out Foxley, an Asian-Vietnamese inspired tapas house.\n\nThe restaurant ambiance doesn't mimic anything I typically associate with a traditional Vietnamese restaurant. It has a classier fine dining style of décor with ginger brick walls and soft lighting; it's a  perfect romantic date spot. In fact, we saw lots of couples there that night all dining on a few plates and enjoying wine.\n\nMy friends and I decided to follow suit, so we split a bottle of red and ordered the most interesting dishes that caught our eyes on the menu. This however, was a task easier said than done. The menu comes on a single-sided laminated sheet, with no pictures. It was hard to distinguish where the descriptions of one dish started and the next one ended. It felt a little like reading an essay! But once you get over the poor formatting, you'll be amazed by the variety of dishes that they offer. There is no shortage of exotic meats and dishes, like frog legs and beef hearts. But if you're not feeling that adventurous, rest assured they also do have many good old reliable classics, like deep fried shrimps, steamed mussels, and spring rolls.\n\nThe first dish that came was the Lamb and Duck Prosciutto Dumplings\" ($7). These were served hot,crunchy and  with jam packed with minced lamb stuffing. They're tasty, but nothing too special..\n\nNext came a Sea Bream Creviche with Yuzu and Shiso ($15). They're bite sizes pieces of thinly sliced sea bream sashimi, covered with coriander and some lime puree. I actually found them to be a little too citrusy for my liking, but it is undeniably fresh. It was paired well with the crunchy fried onions generously sprinkled on top.\n\nAfter that, a whole slew of dishes came at the same time, and it was difficult to figure out which one to dig into first; they all looked and smelled so appetizing! The Grilled Marinated Beef Short Ribs ($14) came on a small plate with about 3-4 pieces. A little too chewy for my liking, but it was at least well marinated and flavourful. In comparison, the Grilled Side Ribs with Caramelized Shallot Glaze ($9.00) were delicious. They were made up of two long pork ribs covered in a savory sweet glaze, with meat that fell right off the bone. We literally demolished that dish in a couple of seconds!\n\nIf you're a big fan of pork belly as I am, then you'll be in for a real treat at Foxley. They serve a Slow-braised Pork Belly in Muscatel Reduction ($15) with nicely marbled fat and cooked in a delicious smokey barbeque sauce ;it just melts in your mouth!\n\nAnd while all those dishes were great, my favourite of the night was the Grilled Beef Heart with Chili Lime Salsa ($8). We ordered it just to try something new, and it was the best decision of the night! It came nicely grilled on two skewers so that the hearts are slightly charred on the outside for flavour, and still tender on the inside. Don't be afraid to try this one, it actually doesn't taste as farfetched as it sounds!\n\nTo balance out all the meat we ordered, the chef recommended the Kale Salad with Pecorino Toscano and Lemon Dressing ($8). I love kale, so in my books this salad was definitely a good order. My only complaint was that the lemon vinaigrette was a bit too sour.\n\nUpon finishing up the meal, the first thought I had was that Foxley is not as \"Asian fusion\" as I had anticipated. There are some influences, but not nearly enough for me to notice the Asian aspect of the menu. That does not go to say that I didn't enjoy my meal though. While I found it was a little on the pricier side, I did enjoy the food and the romantically sophisticated atmosphere. Keep Foxley in your books for either your next date night venue or for a quiet relaxing dinner out with friends.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Everything from Southern-fried chicken and Tenessee pulled pork sandwiches to grilled veg stew and fried tofu sandwiches.

The staff are cool, layed-back, and they actually seem to care that you're there.\n\nBut like I said, all of that can change the next time you go in.

It's an easy little place to overlook; it's just a small shop with little advertising way out on Queen East. But boy am I ever glad I stumbled onto this place. Hands down this was one of the best burgers I've had in Toronto. \n\nFirst off, it was actually cooked a little over medium-- without me asking! Truly a rarity nowadays, the guy at the counter told me they always cook it that temperature. Beautiful. Besides being cooked perfectly, the burger was served on a soft and slightly sweet bun that was matched perfectly with the savoury patty.\n\nThe fries are cut super skinny and fried crispy in-house. While that makes them perfect for eating right away, I do imagine that takeouters will find them soggy once they get to eat them. But for me, it was pure fry bliss.\n\nThe space is modern, clean, and stainless-steel heavy, but because of it's size, it only has seating for about 4 people. Once the place gets a lineup, which at peak times is completely inevitable, the seating area gets really cramped and is unpleasant to eat in.\n\nNext time you happen out to the Beaches, definitely check this place out, or even if you're not in the neighbourhood, this place is totally worth the drive.\n\nCheck out our blog at www.tofoodreviews.com","useful":4,"funny":0,"cool":2}

It has gluten free beer.  It has a cute patio and it's painted to look like a circus tent.  I chose it for all of the aforementioned reasons.  It checked a lot of boxes on my list.  I won't be going back.\n\nThis past weekend found me turning another year older, and because I've been experimenting with a gluten-reduced diet as of late, I decided my birthday dinner should be had at the Kensington Cornerstone.  I looked at pictures.  I perused the menu.  I read reviews.  It all seemed positive.\n\nIt was a beautiful evening, so I was happy that we snagged a spot on the patio.  We had to wait awhile for our drink order to be taken, but at this point we were still taking in our surroundings, people watching (Kensington offers some of the best), and trying to catch passing bubbles being dispensed from somewhere across the street. \n\nJust when I was at the point of helping myself to my neighbouring tables' pitcher of beer, our waitress appeared.  The up side to the wait was that we had enough time to choose not only our drinks but our meals, so we placed all of our orders to make up for lost time.  While we had intended to order one of their pitchers of sangria (and\/or mojitos, and\/or margaritas), we all ended up opting for beer.  My girlfriend and my mom split a pitcher of Upper Canada Lager, while I decided to try one of their 4 gluten free selections.  I figured having a wheat beer with my gluten free meal would be like washing down a pie with a diet pop, so I stuck to my guns.  I've had what Nicklebrook has to offer in the line of GF beer, so I was looking forward to trying a new one.  I asked our server what the most popular one was, and she pointed me in the direction of a red ale by La Messagre that operates out of Montreal.\n\nWhen our drinks arrived, I took that first sip so full of hope, and for a split second I thought I was going to have the chance to gloat in the face of my girlfriend (I know, I'm nice aren't I?) that my beer didn't taste horrible.  I didn't have that chance.  Did I just drink beer?  Or did I just suck on a penny?  Even I was a bit confused at that point.  It started off so well, but then finished with a strong metallic and bitter taste that seemed to coat my tongue and the back of my throat.  Bitter...just like I was at that point.\n\nSo by this time about 30 minutes had passed since we ordered.  Our thirst was quenched but we were more than peckish.  Thank goodness our server was coming our way!  But instead of food, she came bearing bad news.  My girlfriend would not be dining on the stuffed peppers that she had ordered as they had run out, and for some reason, they just thought to tell her now.  Not only would we have to wait even longer for our food, but our plan to share our meals was scrapped as we now both had the pulled pork sandwich coming to us. \n\n(Sound of clock ticking)\n\nAnother half hour passed and our meals finally arrived.  As hungry as I was I couldn't make it through my sandwich ($13).  It looked appetizing enough, but the pork wasn't nearly as tender as it should have been (I've been spoiled by the likes of Fidel Gastro lately), and the sauce was a bit of a turn-off, being too heavy on the tomato and cilantro.  The gluten free bread was quite good, and even had a bit of a cheesy crust but unfortunately it had been sitting in pork juice, so it was now more of a sponge.  Yes, a pulled pork sandwich should definitely be messy, but you should still be able to pick it up. \n\nMy mom was impressed with her salmon ($18), but she wouldn't complain if there was a gun to her head.  It did look good though, and the portion was generous, so not all was lost.\n\nLooking back on it now I wish I had just scrapped the GF diet and stuck with an old faithful restaurant.  What was I thinking trying to eliminate carbs for my birthday dinner?  Why did I go out of my way to both experiment with a restaurant and deprive myself of something I love on my special day?  Who does that?  So while I'm not taking the blame away from the restaurant, I will share some of it with them...but only some as the service was really what ruined our experience.  Maybe the food wasn't amazing, but the fact that we had to wait so long for it was the added insult.  The servers themselves were lovely girls, but somewhere back in the kitchen, the ball was dropped. \n\nAfter we begrudgingly paid our bill, I decided to throw the whole GF thing out the window and head to Ronnie's for a bottle of (gluten rich) 50 to end the night on a positive note. As we sat there on the patio I couldn't help but stare across the road at The Grilled Cheese.  Oh, what could have been.","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":0}

Empowered staff make me a happy camper, so we just left liking them even more.\n\nThey've got Ezra Pound roasted coffee, and prepared ready-to-go items, juices, snacks, and treats, as well as order-in items if you have a little more time. \n\nThere are lots of locally made products like ChocoSol chocolate, Stasis Preserves, Bunner's Cookies, Sweets from the Earth treats, amongst other things.

Not because I particularly liked it, but because it was the main option for a slightly fancier totally vegan night out, with wine (the other tasty option being Vegetarian Haven, without wine.)\n\nA group of 7 of us went on their second day. Is it too early to do a review? Maybe. So take it all with a grain of salt. I hear things are still \"evolving\" and the menu might change. More desserts might appear. Anything could happen. \n\nThe Bar Snax menu looks interesting, and the idea of being able to have drinks and vegan snacks at midnight or 1 am, is promising, especially with Bar Chef next door (which has zero veganizable food options at all according to the last time we went...)\n\nThe Grasslands interior and drink menu is the biggest change when compared with Fressen. And those are really nice improvements. It's brighter, while still being intimate, and has a more open feel, with less cramped seating. \n\nAnother pleasant change is that the servers all seem friendly, and generally helpful.\n\nFood is very Fressen-like, so if you liked Fressen, you will like Grasslands. I had a favourite go-to dish at Fressen.  I ordered the skewer and liked it. Everyone else ordered the seitan roast or the chicken. Bar Snax menu is the biggest change from the former, and it's full of crispy and bite sized options.\n\nMajor problem on our first visit was that we went in a group of 7, which means an automatic gratuity of 18% was added to our bill. But there was nothing on the menu to indicate this, the person taking our reservation didn't let us know, and the servers didn't mention it. Since we're decent people, we obviously added a tip, and so, double tipped. Womp womp.\n\nI'll leave out the Facebook page drama that ensued after we commented about it on their page, but regardless, they did not handle the comments well, and shut off posting on their page entirely. Hopefully it was an educational experience.\n\nTo sum it up: Food is okay. Service is good. Bar (and associated menu) is great. Interior is great.","useful":10,"funny":2,"cool":1}

Staff at Float were super friendly and helpful, and offered me a nice peach tea while I waited for my turn to go in. It was very relaxing.\n\nI've been getting a few questions about the process so I figured it would be helpful to have some idea of what happens when you walk in.\n\nSo this is what happens when you walk in.\n\nI had already paid and made my appointment online, so I just walked in around 15 minutes before my appointment. I signed a release form, drank some tea, and waited until my turn came. A friendly member of the staff showed me to the room I would be using, explained a bit about the tank, and some advice on ear plugs, then he left me alone to do my thing. \n\nThe doors lock, so you have some privacy.\n\nI had the last float of the night, so it was 2 hours long, but standard floats during the day are around 1 hour.  They have 5 rooms, each with flotation tanks in them, and it's easy to make an appointment online, which was a major plus.\n\nEach room has a shower, a bench, and a flotation tank, and a robe. Towels & ear plugs are also provided. They have scent pre-float shampoo & body wash you can use to get ready before going into the tank, and a more scented post-float shampoo and conditioner.\n\nThe flotation tank has about 10 inches of water, and a whole bunch of dissolved salts (for max float potential), so it's easy to get into the tank, sit on the bottom, close the door, lay in the water, and then open it again, or whatever you feel comfortable with. \n\nAt first I was a little anxious about getting lost into the abyss of the tank, and it just seemed to get darker, but as I found out, it's easy to find the door handle in the dark, and easy to open it whenever you need to. So after realizing it wasn't a big deal, and that I could open the door anytime, I closed the door, and floated away 2 hours without realizing it.\n\nWhen your time is up, there is music that comes on, and gets progressively louder to gently wake you or get you out of your relaxed state.\n\nThere is no right way to do it, but I had a great time just floating around with my eyes open, enjoying the feeling of gravity mostly disappear, and also got some really good stretching in as well. Just be careful with the salt water, as you might expect, if you get it in your eyes - it stings! (but there is a towel with a water bottle near the tank door if you need to rinse)\n\nThere was only a brief moment in the beginning of my float when I heard a siren from the street, otherwise, I didn't notice any street noise at all, and considering what I saw when I left Float last night, that's really impressive (lots of police activity, another ambulance that I hadn't heard). I'm usually pretty sensitive to sound, so mostly for me it was nice to have some near-total quiet and no vibrations other than the sound of my heartbeat for a couple of hours.\n\nI think they've got a great set up, and I didn't find their prices high (especially when compared with some other float places I've seen in the past) and they've got a variety of options to choose from on their website. \n\nThe one thing that is worth mentioning, is that after floating and being relaxed and blissed out, walking out onto Queen Street at 1 am on a Friday night can be kind of shocking (not like this is a surprise of course, it's loud, and busy). I know I'd like to try and do a late night 2 hour float during the week next time. Otherwise, I had a really great time.","useful":9,"funny":3,"cool":6}

If not I highly recommend staying away. \n\nIf they made it simple with avocado raw fish and other non over powering tastes then sliced raw jalapeño over it then torched the butter fish it would probably be the best sushi roll here. \n\nVolcano roll was okay but really over done with the sauce quantity which took away from enjoying fish ... Which is why I go out for sushi. \n\nThe sashimi plater (30 pieces) was pretty bad aside from the octopus and 3 of the 9 cuts of salmon.... Everything else was off temperature. \n\nComplimentary salad was small cute and good. \n\nThe miso soup was good. \n\nTea was average. \n\nGinger is really good here.\n\nWasabi is really weak here. \n\n\nI hope the chef seriously considers the suggestion I made about the less sauce and torched raw jalapeño.... Ja Bistro has mastered it and it's incredible.... Maybe the chef should check it out and see what I mean. \n\nWould not recommend this place. Will not be coming back.","useful":5,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I have about 1 3rd or fourth of my body tattooed and this tattoo SAVIOUR turned my several prior tattoo pieces (ribs, shoulders upper back) and with his new addition turned my body into a canvas with one solid flowing united piece. Brilliant engineer in designing.     \n\nAdrenaline is quite pricey ..but if you are getting it done with him IT'S WELL WORTH IT.

The food that we got was delicious (the sea bass skewers are amazingly soft and flaky, and the black truffle sauce that comes with the fried green beans is TDF), BUT the service we got was horrible.  Our server was fine--she was upbeat and tried to work with our wants, but whomever it was that also talked to us was horrible.  \n\nTo be fair, we were a large group (about 14 or 15), and understandably it is hard to accommodate such a large group, let alone trying to get our food out at the same time.  Honestly, I could care less if my food came out at the same time as the people I had been sitting with.  Before we could even look at the menus to see what was available a la carte, the restaurant pushed us into this 'tasting menu' that would \"incorporate our tastes as well as some of their classic dishes\"--sounds fine, but in a group of 14 or 15 people who have VERY varied tastes, that is almost impossible to do.  To begin with, some of our group members didn't eat any raw fish, and others were basically only interested in raw fish.  We eventually agreed to this tasting menu just out of an unwillingness to continue \"fighting\".  They tried to appease by sending us some shooters and edamame, grilled shishito peppers, and fried green beans to start.  Great, and thanks, but still not the best service you could ask for at a restaurant like here. \n\nIf this rating were about the food only, I would give it 5 stars.  The food really is delicious, and the decor (while strange) goes well with the feel that the restaurant seems to be going for.  The pork in our meat sampler platter was overdone and dry, but two types of beefs that were perfectly cooked made up for it.  The appetizer of some sort of spicy tempura rock shrimp salad was moist with the perfect amount of chewiness and spring; it's spicy, but not in the give-me-milk-to-guzzle-now way.  The sushi that we were served, however, was pretty sub-standard.  I'm sure this was because it had to fall in line with our tasting menu price point (which somehow got haggled down); honestly, I did not come to SushiSamba just to get spicy tuna rolls.. I could get that anywhere. \n\nIn short, come here if you're in a small group.  The food really is worth it, many times over.  I'm sure it will be a far more amazing trip than the one I had in a large group.","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":1}

It does NOT get much worse than these guys.  First... a little background, I have never gone out of my way to complain about a company.  If you see my other reviews, you'll notice I go out of my way to rave about companies on here.  There's only 1 other negative review in my portfolio, and even that company is 4 stars compared to crappy old Appliance Certified.  \n\nI used these guys about a year ago, and the guy that came over was cool and the price was reasonable.  So I actually referred them to about 3 people since and kept their magnet on my fridge. \n\nHowever, last week my sink started leaking and we were unable to use it anymore until fixed.  I called this company right away (Thursday) to book appt for the next day (Friday).  No call... no show.  I called back later in the day simply to leave a voicemail.  Saturday I called back and they said they'd have someone out Monday (after apologizing).  Monday came... no call... no show.  Typically, I know you should give up on a poor company like this.  But, I decided to give them one more chance.  Called Tuesday, and set up for today because I had a busy week and couldn't do it until that Friday.  Next Friday came, they called me at 9am to confirm.  Whew... then... didn't show.  1pm I called them and a woman said she'd get on the phone with dispatcher and call me back right away with an ETA.  3 hours later... no call... no show.  I called now twice only to leave another message. \n\nBottom line:  This company shouldn't even be called a company.  The suck.  My 5 year old son is more responsible and considerate. If I had nothing else to do today, I would create 3 more Yelp accounts just so I can complain 3 more times.  One for every time they messed up.","useful":7,"funny":0,"cool":0}

They took a situation that was less than idea at the All Star Race and turned it into a customer service win. Here is what happened. I used Ticketmaster to buy 6 tickets to the All Star Race. I browsed a few sections then wound up buying tickets in Chrysler section K. When we arrived at our section we were informed that it was a no alcohol section. I didn't remember seeing anything on the website (i went back and looked and there was at the checkout page and because of the way I searched I missed the one on the main page) or on my tickets. I was told to go exchange my tickets the gate. The employees at gate 3 said they did not have access to the Ticketmaster system so I would have to go to gate 4. At this point I'm not pleased but I head to gate 4. I show the employee my tickets on my phone and he hands in over to someone else. After about 20 or 30 minutes I'm informed by someone who I assume is a supervisor that the usher is wrong and that our tickets are not in an alcohol free zone and there is no need to exchange them and that the map displayed in the window of the ticket booth showing this as an alcohol free zone was wrong and out of date. At this point we have missed about a 1\/4 of qualifying. We head back to our seats and inform the usher that we were told that it was ok to drink here. He said absolutely not and that the ticket person was wrong. At this point I'm furious. So we walk down into the next section and head toward the bottom to find some open seats and hope we are not sitting in someone else's seats (luckily we weren't as most of them around us filled up). Upon calling the ticket office today and explaining what happened the agent said I did miss the no alcohol writing at the checkout page but offered me 6 tickets to next years race to make up for the inconvenience!!!

Now, I could have been straight up honest and flat out rude about it but it not our style. The man who questioned us could have been a manager but since he never identified himself he could have been anyone. I suggest the zipps staff eat it themselves and find out exactly why it's worthy of sending back.

With Pittsburgh humidity, it gets hot.\n- Wooden walls, so there's not a lot of grip for smearing\n= Price for a day pass is reasonable, but fees for little things like a belay device and chalk add up instead of holding an id for collateral.\n\nBouldering area\n+ Decent number of routes and variety\n- Stiff trampoline floor. Movable pads are big and effective but they aren't everywhere\n\nTop rope area\n-The top rope area is a different section of the building and even has different hours from the bouldering area, which is weird.\n- Ratings are labeled as Easy, Moderate, and Hard with +\/-. Why not put real YDS ratings?\n- For whatever reason, the ropes are just draped over a pole without any loops, so you don't get much friction while lowering.  Therefore, they require the belayer to anchor into the floor for each top rope. Not a big deal, I just haven't seen that requirement in a gym before.\n- Nonsensical rules. I got in trouble for helping my partner go over the safety checks. I passed the belay test, but I was explicitly told not to teach my partner how to perform the safety checks as a climber so I could belay him.  I was told this was for insurance purposes as they don't want anyone but the employees teaching. I waited for the employee to look away so I could safely set up a top rope.  Discouraging learning seems like a bad idea to me.\n\nMaybe I'm just spoiled by the great climbing gyms in San Francisco where I live but there are enough easily remedied flaws that led me to such a low rating.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":0}

They have vegan and gluten-free options in addition to non-vegan\/veg ones.\n\nThe menu is short and simple. At the moment, the vegan options are: grilled quesadillas sin queso (ask for no cheese\/dairy) with either poblano peppers or mushrooms, the sopes with black beans, tlacoyos (bean filled tortillas), and opales (cactus.) All very yummy sounding options. Their tortillas are entirely corn based (and gluten-free) and made fresh every morning. (they also happen to be delicious.)\n\nOther things on the menu I should mention: the horchata. Traditionally milk-less, it's rice based at Maizal, with a cinnamon spice, and perfectly ice cold. \n\nOutdoor patio space is out front on Jefferson, and small but decent. Interior space is ample, but I imagine it's going to be an area lunch time takeout place pleaser, a tasty, healthy meal for under ten dollars. If you sit in like we did, you can read about the history and cultivation of corn on the very aesthetically pleasing chalkboards (and no joke, it really is interesting.) And let me say it again: Air Conditioning.\n\nWe each ordered 2 grilled quesadillas sin-queso (no cheese.) We sat sipping on horchata's while we waited and enjoyed the corn diagrams. They arrived, with pico de gallo on shredded lettuce, and a side of refried beans.  One poblano pepper and one mushroom. One bite and I've decided these tortillas are made of tasty magic. That one bite was all tortilla, and it was so rich in maizey-flavour and texturally superior to nearly all other tortillas I've had up until now (so I eat a lot of tacos...)\n\nThe fillings for both were great, both hearty and satisfying with rich savory flavours.

I have wanted a source for a steady supply of vegan magic squares, and now I have one (p.s. get the magic squares)\n\nI had the opportunity to visit the bakery during the sneak-peak opening in December, and bought magic squares (but not enough), a cookie, and a couple of candied apples and it felt like early Xmas.\n\nThen I waited (im)patiently for their opening this month. And today I braved the snow and went in. I left with dark chocolate croissants, magic squares (obviously), and a pot pie. My partner came home with croissants, a couple of sausage rolls and a whoopie pie. Yes, we're getting ready to hibernate this weekend.\n\nThe croissants are ridiculously flaky, the magic squares are incredible as usual, I haven't eaten anything else yet, but I've sort of come to expect that anything from APiecalypse Now! will be really good.\n\nIn the fridge & freezer so far they've got (all of these things are vegan): cashew ricotta, Caesar salad dressing, flavoured butters, lasagna, pot pies, shepherd pie, gluten free and gluten-full chili mac, potato salad, tzatziki, tartar sauce, Northwood Cold Brew Coffee (which I'm drinking right now - tasty), and more.\n\nI like that there appears to be a sincere effort made to find ethical, ecologically sound, and human friendly products to make & bake stuff, and that they have compostable packaging.\n\nService was friendly and fast & they take cash, credit, and debit.\n\nThere is no seating inside, so prepare to take out.\n\nP.S. try the magic squares.","useful":6,"funny":3,"cool":3}

The weekend hours are not as convenient (they close at 6ish), but I do like that they're open later than most gyms on Fridays.\n\nOne other thing I like is that they have other sport related services available on site. In addition to personal trainers, there are chiropractors, RMTs, a holistic nutritionist, and an ND. It's nice to have the option of just going in, working out, seeing an RMT, or someone else, and going home.\n\nIt's clean, friendly, and welcoming.

Basically I paid $66\/night to stay in this hotel. I would not have minded that if the hotel was just honest about it. I think that it was very sneaky for them to practice such a thing.\n\nThe resort is huge. It's like an apartment complex and since we arrived late at night the grounds were so dark it was tough to find your duplex like room. It was nice that we were connected only to another room. The grounds were clean and quiet. The bed was soft and comfy. The AC was cold and loud. It had room for 2 people and a kid. The furniture was old and the the tv in the living room and bedroom was ancient. I did not even try and use it. The in room safe actually uses a key..lol (not code).\n\nThe room has old stained carpet and the ceilings have beams. The bathroom was old and small. On our first night we actually had no hot water in our room. We showered in lukewarm water. I called the front desk to report it and the lady acted like I was bothering her. The next day at 830 am, thank God we were already awake, with our DND sign on the door we get the maintenance people at our door minimizing our no hot water complain. I insisted they check and surprise, surprise it was broken! I demanded to be moved to another room.\n\nThe man on the phone who moved us was probably the only normal person there. He was appropriate  and helpful.  The rest of the staff in this facility have no customer service skills. They just don't care.\n\nThey also put a $100 hold on your CC when you check in. I am waiting for them to remove that on my CC or I will definitely dispute it.\n\nI would not recommend anyone to stay here.

We were picked up from the Aria tour bus pickup area, which is underground. Once we picked up a few more people at Excalibur, we were whisked away and headed out of town. A surprise stop was first on the list as we stopped at the famous Welcome to Las Vegas sign for anyone who wanted to take pictures. After this, we were were headed up through the mountain pass in an exceptionally clean bus with a friendly bus driver. Alan had picked out some wines for everyone to do a blind taste test (whites on the way to the wineries and reds on the way back). All wines that we tasted were of exceptional quality, although the reds were all tricks as they tasted  very different from the tasting notes listed and the grape varietals selected (no wonder most people gets the red wrong). The first winery we visited was Pahrump Winery. One of the owners, Gretchen, was so very informative and enthusiastic. She was such a delight to interact with and had answers for every question we asked. Following a tour and wine tasting, we settled in for a somewhat formal lunch. This lunch was way more than we could have asked for with the price we paid for the tour. My wife and I, being home wine makers and loving all wines decided to taste a few more wines (which I highly recommend). Some of the wines that weren't on the tasting list for the tour were even better than what we tasted previously. We picked out several of our tastings and Gretchen's friendly staff assisted us with setting up a shipment of wine to our home. We also bought a few wines and the staff discretely handed them off to Alan to load onto the bus for us. We were then on the road again and headed to the next winery, I would say that after the first winery, the second one left me anticipating an equal if not better experience, but I was to be mistaken. The second winery has only been around for a few years and thus has some work to do to build up their quality as my wife and I both placed many of the samples in the wine dump bucket. As well, the tasting room was a bit \"homey\". I hope they can make it work eventually, but at this time it was a bit of a let down from the 1st stop. On our way back, Alan made sure everyone had plenty to drink, but the entertainment choices seemed to be geared towards current pop music and not necessarily the demographics of the tour guests he had at the time. I'm not entirely sure that Alan knows as much about wine as he would like to let on. I would also encourage Alan to actively listen to his guests a bit more instead of just hearing them...if someone says they have interest in eventually opening a winery, the proper response should not be to bring up how expensive it will be or steering them towards another business where they can get help in barreling and buying wine. Listen enthusiastically and respond positively. Aside from these notes, the tour is great for the value. Those who love amazing wine, great food and education on how a winery runs will not be disappointed!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

The staff and service was wonderful, and the provided food was more than satisfactory. Wi-Fi was a decent speed (except in the lobby), and was free to members who join their loyalty program.\n\nThe main issue I had was with the room I stayed in the first night. It faced another room, and therefore didn't have much natural light. I also couldn't leave the curtains open if I wanted privacy. The worst part was the noise. There was a low pitched humming from air conditioning equipment outside the room. The noise wasn't incredibly loud, but it was very grating and made it difficult to get work done or sleep. \n\nThe next day, I asked for a new room. The staff was incredibly friendly and accommodating, and did not make me feel like a nuisance. I got a room that was much quieter, faced the street instead of another room, and had better natural light. I just wish this was true for all the rooms.\n\nOverall, 5 stars for service, 2 stars for the first room, and 4 stars for the second room.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

After we explained that none of us had brought cash (seriously, who pays with cash anymore?) he left for a bit, and then came back and said we could split the check. So, I believe they were just being lazy, since they ended up splitting the check anyway. If they had wanted us to pay with cash, they should have informed us when we made the reservations! Poor management. Overall the serves did a good job though after this incident. \n\nMoving along to the food. The green tea was unlike other green tea that I have had. It had a nutty taste to it that I didn't care for. Perhaps that is more authentic? I don't know, but it wasn't what I was expecting, and didn't drink it. The miso soup was excellent and brought out fairly quickly. Hubby and I shared the gyoza and the spider sushi. The gyoza was crunchy, but not too crunchy, and came in a boat. Nice presentation. The sushi was good too. Nothing out of this world, but good. Another person with us had a noodle dish that looked great. It had scallops, mussels, and shrimp. I didn't try it though, so can't say for sure. And the hot sake was great. Always good to have hot sake with my sushi. And to finish it all off...the green tea ice cream. Now this was delicious, and my favorite part of the evening! Nice and creamy, not overly sweet, but just sweet enough. \n\nBottom line: Don't go with large groups unless you have cash, sushi is ok, but the green tea ice cream is worth the trip.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I urge everyone to choose a different place to get their nails done for the following reasons; firstly she gouged my cuticle super deep as soon as I got there, it was bleeding profusely, dripping down my arm and onto the counter (which she didn't clean up the whole time) and her response to this was to give me a curt \"oops\" then squeeze rubbing alcohol directly onto the cut. Next I told her I wanted the shape to be between almond and stiletto (so pretty pointy but on the shorter side) as I'm watching her file my nails I have no idea what she's doing; she finishes and they're all oval. After phrasing it about six different ways she finally got that I wanted the tips sharper which prompted her to roll her eyes and say \"that's not almond\" uh yes it is. As she was refiling them she messes one of them up and has to take the whole nail off and start again from scratch! The whole time she kept forgetting about the open wound on my hand and would buff and file right over it (which hurt like a bitch) which caused it to rip open again bleed more, I barely even got an apology. Next was the colour fiasco, upon arrival I had chosen a lilac colour with a light pink for the accent nails, she paints the ring fingers first then when it's time to move on the lilac she discovers that it's dried up so she gets up grabs a totally different purple off of the shelf and just starts painting, I grabbed my hand back and asked if I could choose a different colour which prompted an explanation about how the lilac was old, which I already understood I just wanted to choose something totally different. So she throws the chip wheel at me and says \"hurry up\" now I was already at the point of trying not to scream or walk out before and that almost tipped me over the edge (she even pointed out how I was sweating, well yeah I'm trying really hard to not have a freak out) so I pick out my other colour, a grey, so she goes to retrieve it, she comes back starts to paint my nail and it's an orange colour?!? I ask about it and she replies \"oh that colour was discontinued this one is the same number though\" can somebody please explain to me how that makes sense. Yet again I ask to pick a different colour which got a similar response as the first time, finally I pick out a different grey and she finishes painting them. Once that was done she refiles my nails after the polish was already applied(?!) I almost asked to speak to the manager after it was all done but I just wanted to get the hell out of there so I settled up (it cost about $20 more than the usual place I go) this whole time I was perfectly polite and externally calm I even tipped her a little bit because as a server I know what it's like to rely on tips. I only went because this place had such good Yelp reviews, so I feel as if it's my duty to save anyone else considering this place it's worth 0 stars and as a veteran of acrylic nails I know when things aren't right. As a bonus not even two weeks later I had a nail break off, ridiculous.","useful":6,"funny":0,"cool":0}

People at the store were helpful, but they charged my card the minute my order was placed online (on a weekend, when they couldn't be reached by phone), despite my explaining in the comments that I wanted to confirm the color before the order was completed.  They did call to discuss the color, and even sent photos to help me make a decision (especially since shipping to California was VERY expensive).  I got back to them - via e-mail - that I appreciated their help (which I did) but that I was not going to complete the order and, instead, continue to look for a color closer to what I was after.  I said that, if I decided to go with the alternate they suggested (different type of yarn and color), I would get back to them but, for now, I wanted to keep looking.  They responded by saying to let them know, and how nice the other yarn was.  Two weeks later, I get a message that they've shipped yarn to me!  I immediately contacted them, saying I had canceled the order - that I had told them I was going to keep looking and had not accepted their suggestion, but their response was that it'd been two weeks so they automatically shipped.  I'm guessing they've sent the yarn I initially chose online....I have no idea!  They sent me no warning - no confirmation that they were going to ship....and that's when I discovered they'd charged me for the order the minute it was placed - NOT when it was shipped like every other company I've done business with online.  I'm EXTREMELY disappointed and will never do business with them again!  Beware if you give them any credit card info!  They'll use it whether you want them to or not, and the minute they have it....even when nothing has been settled or even shipped yet!!

Their spring rolls are not authentic spring rolls, most likely spring rolls catered for non-asian. Let's see, it took about 10 minutes to get seated and the appetizers came out 15 minutes after we ordered, but after finishing out appetizers and waiting approximately 20-30 minutes after our mains had still not arrived. So we asked the waiter how much longer our main courses would take, he looks at us then looks down at his hand which had our orders. He did not put the orders through! This was horrible service and he did not even apologize, he would looked annoyed anytime he looked at our table. Keep in mind that when we walked in there was only 2 occupied tables. It was already getting late and we decided to wait for the main course. The pho had the weakest broth I have ever tasted. Everyone else food was either cold or bland. HORRIBLE food and TERRIBLE service.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I asked how the shrimp was prepared.  The server said, \"medium, we prepare all of our fish medium.\" Uncooked shrimp? No thanks.  We ordered two appetizers, a salad, steaks, and a side dish.  The oysters were placed on the table without explanation of the accompanying sauces.  The salad was good, tomatoes were fresh.  The lobster mashed potatoes had so much butter that it was pooling around the edges of the bowl.  One steak was overcooked, came out medium well instead of medium rare.  The server took it back and the manager quickly came over to apologize and offered to even cook both steaks again so we could eat together.  We felt it was handled appropriately and would easily have returned for future meals after this.  However, the steak never came out.  I asked the server after a long while to see if it may be ready.  She came back from the kitchen frazzled and said, \"it will be out but I don't have a time to give you.\"  Then a kitchen manager brought a piece of meat, set it down, did not wait for me to cut it open and quickly left. It was very fatty and appeared to be NOT the cut of meat (filet) that I had ordered.  It was over cooked, again.  The server happened to walk over and said, \"yes, I thought that it didn't look right.\"  I left without eating dinner.  She brought the check over and said, \"I'm sure you guys don't want dessert, so I brought the check.\"  The manager never followed up to see if I had received the new steak.  The issues could've easily been solved had someone not dropped the ball and given up on following through.  They did credit the check for two steaks, but really that was not the issue.

We complained to our server multiple times (we had 1 server for a party of 40) that the room was extra hot and there was nothing done about it. I had about 10 guests having to get up to try and cool down outside, fanning themselves and sweating throughout the dinner.

The place is nice and quiet. Menu has a good variety of options from boba to coffee to smoothies. \n\nWe ordered two drinks which was the Classic Taiwanese Milk Tea and the Signature Thai Tea. Milk tea was alright, it wasn't as sweet nor milky as most boba places. Thai tea was just like your regular Thai tea that you get at restaurants. And the boba was unusually smaller than your regular boba which was surprising coming from a boba place.\n\nWhat was really disappointing was the amount of ice that was in the drink! My boyfriend and I took two sips of the milk tea to try the flavor and noticed that the cup was pretty much ice! The 12oz cup (not even the bottle) was filled with 2\/3 ice & 1\/3 tea. I know it's being nit picky but I feel like I got gypped paying $4.50. Mind you, they were out of their cool bottles which comes standard with their drinks and still payed for the same price for a plain regular plastic cup - no name or anything. \n\nOverall, I think Jozo is jumping in with the trend of hipster branding but is lacking quality on the flavor.

Nice enough surroundings.\n\nHad trouble communicating with my barber, whose English was limited. Simple questions were met with blank looks. We managed, but not without difficulty. The haircut was fine, not that I needed anything out of the ordinary. Oddly, the shampoo followed the cut, so he was working with somewhat dirty hair.\n\nThe hot towel shave was a real disappointment. First, the chairs do not recline at all, so there is no sense of relaxation. You either sit up straight and strain your neck to bend your head back, or slide forward in the chair and strain your back. The hot towel is perfunctory. The shave was unpleasant and sometimes painful, and my barber left three nicks on my neck. The cucumber gel afterward was a welcome finish.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I used to go here all the time. The food was delicious. \n\nWhat changed was the portion of food. Most places increase prices when they need to. Not this place. No, what they did here is a disgusting disservice to the customer. They instead lessened the portion of the food by more than twice it was. It's less than the kids portion compared to some places. Yes! So now if you want the similar portion that you had before, then you have to pay for it twice. I think it would still be less than what one portion was though. Which makes this restaurant now grossly overpriced. \n\nFor example, the last time I went here I had a combo plate that was the beef and chicken teriyaki with spam. I asked for no beef and replace with more spam. This is what I usually used to get. So you know what they gave me? 2 tiny pieces of spam! The chicken portion was also minuscule. And a tiny scoop of rice too, not even a whole scoop. \n\nI eat at many places in Vegas and around the country as I travel all the time. I mostly use yelp to give great reviews for amazing places that need more attention from customers. This place though, I logged in for the first time in a long time to give this one star review. It is that bad compared to what they used to be. It is way more expensive than every Manhattan non-waiter place I have been to, along with Chicago, Boston, Seattle, Miami, Toronto, etc. \n\nGuys, if this portion issue has changed please let me know. I will then try it again and see for myself and update my review accordingly. I used to love this place, but now it just still gets me mad when I think about what I paid for and then got.\n\nUPDATE: May 2017\nI want back again to see if they changed anything. I went back again to see if it was a fluke. It looks like they did raise the portions. Not as big as it used to be but this is much better then before where I gave a one star review.

We were told that the room that they held for us were given to people that stayed longer and that our rooms were not guaranteed, even though we booked them about a year in advance.  That makes no sense whatsoever.  We told her we were part of a wedding party that had blocked a bunch of rooms, but they still didn't care.  When they said they had 2 rooms available, the rooms were in 2 separate buildings away from where the bride had wanted us to stay.  We told the lady where we wanted to stay and she said come back in a hour and they should be ready.\n\nWe came back exactly an hour later, only to be told they weren't ready yet.  The lady had us sit and wait 20 more minutes while she waited on a call back to make sure the rooms were clean.  They also had one room with a King bed and one room with 2 doubles, even though my friend and I had both booked rooms with King beds.  I let her have the King room, but once again, what's the point of reserving a room, if you aren't going to get what you asked for.\n\nMy room was okay.  I didn't have problems like my friend had with the sink and safe.  I did not like that you could hear people above you walking or running.  That was really loud.  Also, even though there are shades to keep the light out, it was still bright once the sun started to rise and that made me wake up way earlier than I wanted to.\n\nAfter the first day, my room was not cleaned by 3:00 p.m.  When I was getting ready to meet my friends, the cleaning lady came back around 3:30 p.m. and I told her I will be leaving soon and to come back.  On the day I was leaving, she knocked on my door at 9:00 a.m. to see when she could clean my room and I told her I was leaving today.  Shouldn't she know that?\n\nThe food at the Mexican restaurant and Marilyn's Cafe was just so-so.  We only ate there b\/c there was noting else, but it wasn't that great.  I would have gone somewhere else, if there was something else close by.\n\nThe bar in the lobby would have been okay if it wasn't for the jazz music.  I'm not a fan of jazz and did not want to hear it.  Also, the prices for drinks in that bar are ridiculous!!!  My friend and I ordered Shirley Temple's, which consist of Sprite and cherry flavor and they cost $4 each!!!!!!!!  What the heck!?  Also, a small bottle of water, about half the size of a regular bottle, was $4!!!  That is so ridiculous!\n\nThe pool was probably the only thing that wasn't that bad.  We were able to get lounge chairs both times we went to the pool.  I know people I was with were annoyed with the one waitress that was going around getting drink and food orders.  She was taking forever on some things and even gave food to the wrong people.  \n\nOn my last day, I had checked out and wanted to spend a few hours at the pool.  I went into the bathroom to change and I came out and put my stuff on the counter.  The cleaning lady was in there staring at me with an annoyed look, so I asked her if I was in her way.  She rudely said yes and I asked her if I should move to one side or something and she huffed out saying, something about coming back.  So uncalled for!!\n\nWhen it was time to leave, we asked the bellman to get us a cab and he waited about 10-15 mins until he called for one, which of course made us late to get to the airport.\n\nI definitely won't be staying at this hotel again.

I love how cozy the space is when you walk in and how family-oriented the workers are. \n\nMy first visit was just a quick exam with suggestions of switching out chemical-filled products. I was even gifted a sample for my inflamed cystic acne. The Green Tea Gel Cleanser, I believe. I like it for when I don't wear make up and just need a quick clean at the end of the night. \n\nOn my second visit, I had the pleasure of getting a personalized facial from Diana, who I adore! She's super informative and really taught me a lot about how my diet would affect my break outs.

I grew up without proper dental visits, resulting in 4 decayed molars. \n\nAt 18, I took myself to one of those chain dental offices and paid over $1500 for two root canals. I was never given an explanation as to what a root canal was or that I'd need to pay for crowns separately. So, I got the roots taken care of but due to insufficient funds (because I'm 18!) I couldn't afford crowns to keep them secure. \n\nFrom 19-21, I hopped from local dentists to dental schools, and even Mexico to save money on the treatments (crowns, bone grafts). I couldn't pull through with most places because they were discomforting and too business-like. \n\nFinally I found this place on yelp and after the consultation with Dr. Walker, I knew I could trust his work. He thoroughly went over my teeth, proposed a treatment plan, and even broke it down into separate operations to help lessen the financial stress. Most dental places feel fancy and the work they suggest never seems necessary (like they just want my money), but here, I understood the importance of each extraction and surgery because Dr. Walker took the time to explain things. \n\nIn the past few months we extracted a tooth, did a bone graft, and a root canal retreatment. All were extremely terrifying at first, but I trusted him. Everything went smoothly and even when the retreatment got complicated Dr. Walker comforted me by staying positive and updating me throughout the procedure. (The scariest thing is hearing someone say \"oh no\" without a follow-up) To be honest, I was trying to stay awake so I could keep my mouth open; it was that easy-going in the room. \n\nI genuinely appreciate the work he's done and can't say enough about how great my endo experience was. \n\n*the receptionists and assistants are always a pleasure as well.

It was outright awkward. One person in the party didn't get their food, then another guest was accused of taking that dish - but I guess the server didn't punch in the order correctly for the ticket? It was just weird and uncomfortable. Another guest asked for help in getting drinks ordered, and no one would respond. I'd have typically given it 1 star, but hopefully I came here on an atypical night, and would like to give them the benefit of the doubt...or maybe suggest take-out to fellow yelpers? :)","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I walked in one day on the spur of the moment with my fiancé, and made an appointment for later in the week (when he wouldn't be there).  When I arrived with my mom that morning, I was greeted promptly by the friendly girl at the desk.  She got basic info from me on what I was looking for\/budget\/etc.  We then were led to the fitting area with my consultant, Tatiana.  After reviewing what I was looking for, she started to pull a few dresses at a time for me to try on.  She took the time to ask me what I liked and didn't like from each of my dresses.  She was really sweet, professional, and genuine.  I told myself I wasn't going to buy a dress at my first appointment ever...but after 3 hours of trying on dresses, and trying my favorites back on a second time...I selected the gown of my dreams!  Not only was I never rushed, or ever made to feel like I was just a sale, my consultant Tatiana made me feel like an instant friend for the day.  She didn't try to blow through my budget and bring me dresses that were on the high end of my budget - she really did try her best to make me feel amazing and beautiful.  I ended up picking a dress that wasn't even what I had in mind - and I'm so glad for it!  The manager was also very polite and my mom and I were happy she took the time to introduce herself to us.  Yes the store had other brides, and yes there were others looking in the mirrors, and yes my consultant had to split her time...but it's such an exciting moment - I didn't realize how much time was passing, and it took some pressure off to not have her there standing by me the whole time, allowing me to talk to my mom about each dress.  As someone who also works in guest service, I can tell you Tatiana was great at multi-tasking - she gave me all the time I needed, and when she was working with me, she had her focus completely on me.  When I came back to the store a few weeks later to pick up my ordered sash, I had another great experience!  The lady at the desk this time also greeted me, and helped me find the headpieces (since I now wanted to try them on too)!  A consultant who was in the area was really kind, and he asked me if I needed help, and offered suggestions for what I was looking for.  When I finally made my way to the counter an pick up what I was actually there to get (my order), the manager and consultant there were both great...I am honestly blown away with it all, because I know it's rare to find that level of incredible service from a large chain.  Thank you, Tatiana, and the whole crew at this David's Bridal location!  I'll be sure to come back and get all my bridesmaid dresses \/ accessories very soon.  :)","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Their bacon board and apple pie moonshine is out of this world.\n\nAfter we had the bacon board, my husband and I took our server's suggestion and ordered their short ribs, which our server said were phenomenal. The short ribs come with fried coleslaw and we asked the server if we could sub asparagus and not get the fried coleslaw. So, the short ribs and asparagus come out. The short ribs were tough, small, and didn't have much flavor.\n\nThen, when our bill came we were charged the full amount of the short ribs and coleslaw, and an additional $4 for our asparagus, which clearly shows that it's $4 on it's own. So, why did we have to pay full price to sub them and then not get a side that was supposed to come with our meal? So, we basically paid full price to not receive a side, and paid an extra four dollars for asparagus that would have been $4 regardless if it was subbed or not. \n\nWe also experienced some issues splitting our bill and my husband and I were charged $30 more than we were supposed to be, even after telling our server that some of the items on our receipt weren't ours before she swiped our card. We were still overcharged and had to cancel one tab, but still be recharged for the other.\n\nThis place started out a wonderful experience but it seemed to get worse and worse as the night when on.\n\nI will definitely go back, but only for the bacon board and moonshine, not the entrees.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0}

If you want a new car, save yourself time and money by going to Power Toyota in Tempe. A year ago my boyfriend and I bought a brand new four runner from Big 2. They seemed nice when we were there but our payments were outrageous. A year later we decided we needed to trade our vehicle in because the payments were so high. We went to Power and they asked for our contract. We gave them all our paperwork Big 2 had given us and came to find out they never gave us a copy of the contract. They also told us our payments were so high because almost $8,000 of stuff was added on to our contract that we didn't need. They even added a life insurance policy for over 3,000...guess what...I was 21 at that time and my bf was 24. We had no idea that we had agreed to all that stuff and felt so stupid that we let them take advantage of us. Power Toyota pulled some major strings to help us because we had so much negative equity. Now, Big 2 owes us a lot of money in cancellation refunds and when I called to find out the status of our refund they said they'd call me back and never did. I even left a voicemail for the finance director, Brian, and never heard from him. My boyfriend went through the same thing. Today, after pulling some strings we finally got them to call us back and we find out they lost our paperwork. Horrible business full of deceitful, uncaring, unprofessional people. Toyota is a wonderful company and Big 2 completely hurts their image. Once I get my refund I will never do business with them again and tell all my friends and family to avoid them and go to Power where they are not looked at as a number but as a person.","useful":14,"funny":1,"cool":0}

From the planning of the ceremony to the initial consultation at the venue to the actual ceremony to the photo viewing appointment after the ceremony...we were very, very happy with everything!!  Yvette Prather was our wedding coordinator and the first person we had contacted about booking our wedding there. She was very helpful with getting all of my questions answered and addressing all of the concerns that I had. Our package included a luxury sedan picking us up from our hotel and taking us to get our marriage license and then to the initial consultation at the venue. The driver of the luxury sedan was awesome and super sweet...she even gave us a card to congratulate us on the wedding. Very thoughtful!! Once we got to the venue to see it for the first time and have the consultation, we worked with Danielle. She was amazing!! She was very friendly and answered all of the questions that we had. We were also very happy with the Terrace!! I could see where it would be a little small for people who have a lot of guests. For our wedding, it was just my husband and I and the venue could not be more perfect. We had another luxury sedan driver that dropped us off for brunch after the consultation, and he was awesome too!! Our package also included a limo driver to take us to and from the ceremony, and that limo driver was amazing and very nice and friendly as well. A few minutes after we arrived for our ceremony, they brought us upstairs to wait in the bridal suite. We probably stayed in there for 30 minutes or so before our ceremony started. It was so nice that we got to stay in there before the ceremony because they do have other weddings going on at the same time and it made us feel special and like it was just our day. While we were waiting in the bridal suite, we met Reverend Garcia, who was very nice and sweet and just all around awesome. We also had several pictures taken in the bridal suite, and our photographer was amazing and did a wonderful job. Our ceremony went off without a hitch. We chose 2 songs to play when I walked down the aisle and then when we walked out and that made it very sentimental and special. We were also each able to recite our own vows, which made it even more personal. I had chosen to have the rose petals sprinkled down the aisle as well and was very happy with that decision as it turned out looking great. All in all, the venue was spectacular!! We had a 9:30 PM ceremony and it just turned out so lovely at that time because the gazebo is lit up and looks beautiful. We were very, very pleased with the venue!! We had some friends and family members who watched the online live streaming of our ceremony back home, and they said that it turned out great and they felt like they were able to join in on our special day. After the ceremony, we had more pictures taken (which pretty much all turned out awesome by the way), and then we checked out by giving them the address to mail our marriage certificate to. After the ceremony, our limo driver dropped us off at Top of the World restaurant at the Stratosphere, and he was just as kind as could be. We had our photo viewing appointment back at Vegas Weddings the morning after our ceremony. At that appointment (less than 12 hours after our ceremony had ended), we were able to view a wedding slideshow of pictures that they had edited. We absolutely fell in love with the majority of the pictures that they had taken and ended up just purchasing our entire photo package at that time. The entire package is kind of pricy, but it is only a fraction of what we would have paid a photographer back home if we had had a \"traditional\" ceremony. They were able to give us a CD copy of our wedding slideshow, a DVD copy of our wedding video, and a CD copy of all of our wedding pictures in color, sepia, black and white, and thumbnail versions in hand at the end of that appointment...which means that we received all of that less than 12 hours after our ceremony had ended. And the pictures were high quality and turned out so beautiful!! I was floored!! Especially when I hear of so many people complaining that they have not received their wedding photos a month or more after their wedding. I was very blown away that they had everything done and ready to go that quickly!! It was awesome!! And the quality of our wedding video was amazing too...it turned out so well!! Everyone that we worked with through Vegas Weddings was very friendly, helpful, and dedicated to making our wedding experience there as special for us as possible. We would recommend for anyone considering getting married in Vegas to get married at Vegas Weddings!!!! I will even be telling people who are engaged and not sure of what they want their wedding to be like yet to go to Vegas just to get married at Vegas Weddings!! It is an awesome place!!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Unfortunately our experience wasn't everything we expected it to be. The main issues that we had was that our countertop was cut into two pieces to fit together, which sounded fine. But they cut a straight line instead of the typical angled line that you see. The straight line makes it so much easier to see. AND the worst part is that the color is so off its extremely obvious to see the line. We just feel that an effort to match the colors at the line should have been made. A few minor issues is that the countertops didn't fit the walls because our walls weren't straight. Which of course isn't Stabella's problem, but the sales rep initially told us that if this happened on sight the installers would just cut the wall a little to slide the counter tops in so everything would be flush with the wall. But when the installers got there they said they couldn't do that because the line (where the two pieces were cut and were supposed to meet) wouldn't be flush. We also decided not to get a backsplash because the sales rep talked us into how \"new\" and \"modern\" looking it would be. But then when we ran into the problems with the wall not being straight we wish we had just ordered the backsplash to hide the issues in the wall. Once again, that's not Stabella's fault that our wall wasn't straight but we just wish the sales rep had been a little more realistic instead of making everything seem like roses and daisies. In the end this left us feeling dissatisfied because we expected different things based on the initial sales pitch. Going back to the line where the two pieces met and one side was much darker than the other, they told us that the granite cutters were instructed to put the darker piece in be back. So what that told me is that Stabella was 100% aware of the drastic change in color while they were cutting our granite ... And the didn't care or even think that would bother us? They just sent it out to be installed at our house anyways. They offered to have an installer come out and apply a darkening agent to the lighter side..but why wasn't this done when the granite was still in their factory being cut? It would have saved everyone a lot of trouble and things would have been done right in the first place. We declined having them come back out to apply the darkening agent because we were worried it would end up looking worse and then we'd really be screwed. Let me add that after we notified them we were declining their offer to come out and darken the countertops, we NEVER heard from them again. We NEVER at any point in the process heard an apology that we weren't 100% satisfied, they never bothered to reassure us that their work would look great after they applied the darkening agent and they'd really like to make it right...nothing. Long story short, I would never recommend Stabella and we've even gone so far as to give their name to some acquaintances and say they're who we recommend you NOT use. Stabella might get away with taking our money and leaving us dissatisfied, but we'll do our best to keep people we know from using them.","useful":12,"funny":1,"cool":2}

I'm 6' tall, so when my bride was at the store choosing a dress she specifically asked the sales lady if the dress could be ordered in extra long. The lady looked in the computer and told my bride that the dress could be ordered in extra long. Great! So I go to buy my dress, and the sales associate tells me that the dress is on sale for almost half the price. Great! I was ecstatic. So I pay for the dress, and as I'm walking out the door I return to ask the date that the dress will be in. The lady goes back in the computer system and says \"whoops, I accidentally did your dress as a take off the rack instead of an order.\" So basically, if I would have walked out of the store my dress never would have been ordered. How upsetting is that! Well, as she look in the computer system to actually place the order, she finds that the dress is discontinued in extra long. So basically, she lied to my bride when she told her that the dress could be ordered in extra long. So I'm polite and say that it's fine and I'll just order the regular length and it will just be short on me - well then they tell me that I owe an additional $50, because the regular length dress was not on sale. I asked to speak to the manager to see if she would honor the discounted price, since that is what they told me that I would be owed. And the manager was extremely rude and would not honor that discounted price. Super bad customer service. First, they lied to my bride - the dress was not available in extra long. They lied to me - they didn't order the dress, and it never would have been caught if I didn't ask them to confirm the date that it would be in. And then they wouldn't honor the lower price of the discontinued dress. Honoring the regular length dress at the extra length dress's price would have made me feel a whole lot better about the situation. They basically said \"sorry, it's not available.\" And that's all that they would do to remedy the situation. Very disappointed!!! I will be recommending to anybody that I know who is getting married to NOT use David's Bridal. If it weren't for my anal double checking personality, I never would have asked when my dress would be in, and the dress never would have been ordered. The wedding would have been here and I would have had no dress! If you are ordering from them, I would definitely suggest double, triple checking that your dress has been ordered. Otherwise, who knows if it will ever come in.","useful":5,"funny":0,"cool":1}

Today was my first and last time coming here.\nLet's start with my experience with scheduling the appointment. I called the salon and was answered by a man's voice with a simple, \"Hello?\" I wasn't sure if I dialed the correct number since that was the only thing he said. I asked if it was Binh's Hair Salon and he replied with \"Yeah.\" As that should have been my sign to just hang up and schedule elsewhere, I proceeded to give the business the benefit of the doubt and asked if I could schedule an appointment. The man said, \"Yeah, sure,\" and hung up as soon as I said my requested date and time.\nSo, the appointment day came and I arrived early. When it was my turn, the woman at the desk told me I could sit in the next available chair. I asked if I could get my hair washed prior to my haircut and she quickly said, \"You can or you don't have to, it's five dollars extra if you want your hair washed,\" and I said yes that's fine. She responded in a way as if it were an inconvenience for her to wash my hair as she directed me to the sink.\nFast forward to the hair cut: as he was cutting my hair, he kept looking away and glancing at the door as he snipped my hair!! My hair ended up looking choppy and uneven. I was so upset with the results, but I didn't want to cause a scene and just paid quickly in order to leave asap.The woman's demeanor quickly changed and she was all of sudden super nice and polite as I pulled out my payment.\nIf you're wondering, no it has nothing to do with the language barrier, because I'm Vietnamese as well! They were just incredibly rude and unprofessional. Poor quality hair cut and poor attitudes. I thought the other reviews were more honest, but I think it's inaccurate. I probably could have gotten a better haircut and service from a student stylist.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I love Sashimi salads and have enjoyed many good ones in many sushi different restaurants. Since I am in town from So. Cal on business and wanted to grab a quick, healthy and light lunch between appointments I decided to Yelp Japanese restaurants in my vicinity. I was delighted to see Hanabi was close by and had a 4.5* rating by 150+ people. When I arrived at the restaurant at 12:30 pm, the peak of lunch hour, on a Wednesday I thought it was odd that a restaurant so highly rated was nearly empty except for one other table. \n After I ordered and my sashimi salad arrived I understood why the place was so empty. \nMost sashimi salads I've had are made with healthy rich greens and other vegetables and a pretty decent amount of sashimi  making for a colorful, healthy and satisfying meal. The size of these salads are usually served in plates about 8-10\" in diameter. The sashimi salad at Hanabi was made up of a small amount of ice berg lettuce, one strand of pickled carrot, a small clump of white shredded radish with about 6 small pieces of sashimi served on a small rectangular plate approx 4\"x6\". The cost of this sad salad was $15, the same as what I have paid in other restaurants where I got a lot more. After my experience at Hanabi I find their ratings and review very suspect. I know it was just one item on their menu but the fact that no other customer came in by the time I left really makes me question the reviews. Sorry no offense to those who have submitted good reviews. Glad you had a good experience but I definitely was disappointed, left hungry and very dissatisfied.","useful":2,"funny":3,"cool":0}

So, in the area of actual Navajo food, the Scared Hogan does it well. As for the expense, its organic as you can get, but thats the Navajo food way, and not advertised and used as a gimmick, like the american food way, hence, its a bit more in cost. An example is, the mutton (sheep) is bought on the Navajo Nation. Navajo's know tis because we cantaste the difference, between a sheep raised on Navajo land vegetation and sheep not raised on it. \nAll in all, the Sacred Hogan, is the best traditional style Navajo food served in the greater Phoenix area, except at my house, haha.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1}

There was an egg on top, but it didn't feel like there was egg in the sauce (and thus I felt it was not creamy enough). Pizza was alright. The side dishes were good except for the rosemary fries. I thought that there could've been more rosemary flavour to it. (Note: after we finished the fries, we then realized that the seasonings were all on the bottom of the bowl the fries came with!! So, hint: toss your fries before you devour!). We also had one of the salads (the Tuscan salad?) and it was very flavourful. \nAll in all, dinner at Scaddabush was a good experience! The setting was nice and seating was comfortable. One small thing I would've liked: complimentary bread!! ;)","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

These were made up of a few greens and half a tomato. Seriously? \n\nFor my entree I ordered a mixed veggie type pasta with oil and garlic. 20 bucks down the drain. My boyfriend had the 'special' which was Cioppino. It was 36 dollars and his stomach is feeling ever dollar of it. \n\nWe took our left overs because we just do that and don't want to be wasteful. On the way home the smell of it was so bad we had to pull over to toss it out. \n\nThis place is a crock. They couldn't get me to eat here again at fast food prices. \n\nFor 4 people (And only 2 cocktails) our bill came out to 180 bucks. What a rip off.","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":0}

I went to the oil change guy first and he said he would take the car to get washed after he was done. about 20 minutes later he shows up to tell me that my filter needed changing and I say go ahead. He then tells me he will only take a few minutes and then off to the car wash. So there I am waiting patiently for my car to be done. I hate to be a pain so I wait without any concerns thinking to myself, these people know what they are doing. WRONG, i am waiting and waiting, finally i go see for myself what could be taking so long. The car was parked in the lot. No one ever bothered to inform me that my car was done. I complained to cashier who passed me off to the car wash manager. He apologized for the poor service and blamed it on the oil change guys. Said they were supposed to call me when it was done. Yeah right, they change oil not wash cars. They have no checks and balances over there. They don't work together as a complete service team. Next time I will just go to Jiffy. They are more professional. Lesson for others, if you get two services done, don't assume they work together. You are on your own to figure who is done with what and be your own customer service because they have none there.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I am not able to say my experience with the car I was sold was a good one. In the first 3 months the car was in the mechanics shop 5 separate times. The first problem happened in the first 48 hours. Granted the dealership paid for that repair since the warranty refused to. And the fifth trip to the mechanic was also paid for by the dealer. None the less, when the first problem happened I was told that if trouble persisted I would be placed in a different vehicle. 5 separate trips to the mechanic showed a persisting problem. I wasn't placed in a different vehicle. This vehicle has been nothing but a money pit from the start. I will not be replacing the engine. \n    This vehicle has not been reliable. I felt I was left no other choice but to go and get a new car that is reliable from a reputable dealership. I understand that there are people that have had good experiences with getting a car from good carma. Unfortunately I cannot say my experience was among them. I paid for a 3 month warranty that refused to cover repairs that were included in the warranty agreement. \n    So here is my revised and updated review.

The employee there was so rude.\nSo, my friend and I came into the store first.  No greeting.  I mean, whatever, nothing too big to complain about.  We were browsing the flavours when two other girls came into the store.  The employee then talked to them and they seemed to be friends.  After two minutes, we were ready to order and the employee was still talking to the two girls for around 5-10 minutes.  She also served them first! (Ha!)  It wasn't until her friend stopped (annoyed) and pointed at us, whispering, apparently signalling for her friend (the employee) to go and serve us.  The employee also looked annoyed that she had to stop her conversation 'cus we wanted to order something... so anyway, we asked her if she had the Cookies & Cream flavour and she just replied, \"No.\"  That's it!  and then she went back to her friends.  She didn't even say, \"Sorry\" \"Do you want anything else\" and she didn't even ask my friend who was actually ready to order her Pistachio ice cream.  She just said one word and went back to talk to her friends.  \n\nIt was like we weren't even there!  I find it so rude to be treated as if you don't even exist.

My grandfather is a 93 year old man that can't hear well and can't speak all that clearly. The server misunderstood what he ordered and when utensils were brought out for the food, it was clear there had been a mistake. Instead of apologizing for it, the server got defensive and said that she had repeated the order and no one corrected it. She went back to the kitchen and corrected it, then came out and asked him if he was ok with that. He said of course, because it's what he ordered and she said yes, you better be ok with that. She started off quite friendly, and she ended quite friendly, but this caused some tension. \n\nMy other complaint would be the amount of time it took.

Thank god we had a Groupon deal... I can't imagine paying for this meal full price.\n\nWe made reservations and when we arrived 5 minutes early, the waitress looked at us like she had no idea what to do with us. This restaurant is very small - only 10 tables, but there was a table for 4 and a table for 2. I'm not sure what's hard to determine on where to seat 2 people? The waitress had to ask someone else for help on where to seat us. \n\nEventually got seated, ordered drinks (pop) and were told the specials. My husband ordered the burger, I ordered their steak special. My first mistake was not asking how much the steak cost. I would have expected a little under $30 and instead it was $34. A little overpriced. The burger is more than fair at $17 and a huge portion. \n\nThe problem with this place is the absolute asinine prices they charge for pop. The two of us each ordered a Diet Coke and then asked for refills. The bill came out to $16 just for the drinks!!! 16 freaking dollars for soda!! We could by 3 cases of pop for this. Instead, we probably had 3 cans between the two of us. I had to pick my jaw up off the floor when I saw this charge. \n\nIn terms of food, it was pretty tasty. \n\nFor service, we had problems getting the refills (maybe we would have been better off if the service had been worse and we didn't get them at all). It also took an hour and 45 minutes for one course. I noticed the table beside us had to ask 3 times for their drink. \n\nOh yes, and every table around us had bread on their table but we got nothing.","useful":6,"funny":2,"cool":2}

I tried this and had a Cesar salad which had nice and creamy dressing, the pappardelle alfredo which was pretty bland, and then a scoop of gelato. The gelato was vanilla and pretty good, however I wasn't allowed to choose what flavour I wanted. Is vanilla the only flavour they have? Overall, a pretty blase meal. \n\nService was ok, nothing special.

As requested, they gave us a table so we could see the Bellagio fountains.  Our reservation was at 9 PM and we were disappointed to find out that the chef was no longer offering the tasting menu that evening. Our waiter, however, said we could create our own tasting - excellent!  \n\nWe started with the polenta with mushrooms - delicious, but it maybe could have used a bit more salt. Next up was the infamous $24 spaghetti. Well worth it - this is the best pasta I ever ate. Since we were indulging, the next course was more pasta. The duck and foie gras ravioli. It was good, but very rich and not even close to as good as the beef cheek ravioli from Carnevino. I am not sure why people would compare the two. On carb overload we then had the lamb which was fantastic. For some reason they also sent out a duck entree which we had not ordered. Not a fan of the spices - cardamom and clove. Nor was I a fan of the waiter attempting to charge us for it. \nDessert was the chocolate salted caramel cake. Good, but nothing to rave about. \n\nWine prices are high but on par with everything else on the strip. \n\nOh, I almost forgot the bread basket and dipping sauces. The Stromboli bread with salami and cheese is phenomenal. The marscapone butter could make even cheap white bread taste good. \n\nDefinitely worth a visit to try the spaghetti.

The team at pure plumbing came out to check on a few things on the house I just purchased.  They looked at a old water softener system that was no longer functional. After discussion, they suggested a new system that provides softening and filtration.  I did NOT feel pressured for purchase.  Instead, they gave me all the information and allowed me to make my own decision.  After giving the thumbs up, they were back in a couple of hours SAME DAY with the new system and got it all installed.  All questions I had about other repairs on the property (replacing outdoor piping, checking for leaks, etc) were answered without ego or frustration.\n\nAnother problem they found was I had a leak in my laundry room that had been present for quite some time.  It caused damage to the drywall and required repair.  They referred me to an excellent service and repaired the leak by installing new valves.\n\nA couple days later, after moving in and getting my washer and dryer installed, I called AFTERHOURS and was surprised to get a callback almost immediately.  They came out next day to install the gas line for my dryer and check my gas fireplace quickly.\n\nThis service is amazing.

I happen to be in the store the day she came in trying to pick up her table on that Sunday. Her paperwork clearly said Monday and she had the wrong day. In fact I had to stop getting customer service so they could help her. She was yelling through the store and cussing at them using profanity I had my children in there. Total white trash is how she acted. I had to stay in the store until after they closed because of her stunt going over to the other store. She went to pick up her table at the 59th Ave. and Bell location she put it in her truck and she left and never paid for.  The owners daughter on the E. Bell Rd. location called her several times as I was sitting right in front of her. Rik never picked up her phone. I would say in the 15 minutes before she called the police she had to have called for probably 10 times. She knew she owed the money when she loaded the table she should have paid for it then. Howie world was left with nothing left but to call the police to protect themselves. I have never seen someone in my life be so rude to people in a store as this Riki was. Howie world was not rude to her or mean to her. She wanted them to deliver something on a different day and hour before closing. And it simply could not have been done. Riki Did not read her paperwork for the delivery date she messed up and she wanted them to take the blame for it And she drove the other location picked up the merchandise and didn't pay for.

I did some research online and time and again the advice I came across was to get a realtor. This then led to the next challenge: how would I choose my realtor? \n\nAnd to Yelp I went. Rebecca's name popped up near the top with great reviews stating how professional and involved she was (both very true). Upon visiting her website, I was instantly struck by how straightforward and open she seemed. Her bio is down-to-earth and includes details that make you feel comfortable and like you're about to get down to work with an old friend.\n\nTo me, she was the obvious first and only choice. I'm so glad I picked her! \n\nAfter sending her a detailed email of my situation and rental needs, she replied promptly and with positivity, reassuring me that while my situation was unique, it was hardly impossible. She set to work adding me to a database that would email me potential rentals that featured the specific things I was looking for. So awesome to be able to apartment hunt from your inbox! \n\nI did indeed find the perfect place, and I couldn't have done it without Rebecca. She made communicating with the landlords and their realtors a breeze and was able to prepare the lease and handle other details, freeing me to focus on other things associated with an international move.\n\nRebecca actually cares about her clients, and finding them the right rental or forever home is both her goal and her specialty.

I looked online and saw that this store carried Blundstone boots. The official Blundstone site even listed this shop as having the boots I wanted - #584 - in stock. \n\nAnd then I went inside. The saleswoman wasn't what I'd call warm, but coming from NYC, I can be used to brusque salespeople. She informed me that they did not have my size in that particular boot in stock, but that I could check back in September. I then asked if I could try on another pair of Blundstones just to see how they feel on your feet since I've never owned a pair. The saleslady seemed put off. She told me that they wouldn't fit the same as the winter boots. I told her, I was aware of that, but if I was in the store, I'd still like to try a pair on to see if I even like the brand, especially if I was to wait until September for the ones I want. These boots aren't cheap either, so yeah, trying any pair on can give some insight into their fit.\n\nShe actually continued to dissuade me from trying them on. Someone whose very job revolves around getting people to buy shoes. It was confusing and she came off seeming like I was putting her out by asking her to pull a box of boots from the back. \n\nI repeated again that, if I'm going to spend that much money, I want to know what I'm getting into, and would like to know how any iteration of the boots fit. She finally acquiesced and went and got me the boots.\n\nWhile all of this was going on, I felt awful. Unwelcome and unwanted. There was literally one other customer in the store with her mom. And me, being treated like I'm dumb for wanting to try on a pair of shoes.\n\nI can say that many other stores in Toronto sell Blundstone boots and I would suggest if you would like to experience being treated with respect and decency, to avoid this store. Especially as a new arrival to this city, this kind of experience leaves me feeling flummoxed and bummed out. \n\nI should point out that I proceeded to pop into five or so other shops after going into this store, and every salesperson that greeted me did so with enthusiasm and kindness and provided exemplary customer service.\n\nWe all make choices with our wallets.

The staff always have attitude and are not helpful at all especially the manager. I ordered the low fat mango smoothie. Although the store promotes a healthy attitude towards food and appears to use the freshest ingredients this place is far from healthy. The person making my smoothie jus poured in some sugar filled mixture into the blender and added sugar filled frozen yogurt. This drink was full of preservatives and sugar. Definitely not worth the calories or the price. And I could do without the attitude.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":0}

You will walk and walk and walk - you get the picture. I would take a blanket and a picnic lunch and a refillable water bottle is a must.\nGive yourself 4-6 hours to look around - all day if you want to see the entire park.\nI LOVED the insectorium!\nWe were there for the lantern show which was a nice little bonus, although it was a bit crowded.\nEasy walk from metro Pie IX","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

My husband got the bagel sandwich with egg and cheese.  I was a little disappointed in the lack of vegetarian options if you weren't in the mood for something sweet.  They had tons of combo options that looked delicious but not a single one was veggie - boo. \nWe enjoyed our breakfast.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

After being seated it had taken a while to place orders, we didn't get bread until we asked for it as we happened to catch the waitress walking passed. Then we got bread an side salad with the meal. There was a weird smell coming from the butter an shortly after not finishing half of my meal, I felt sick an resulted in vomit. I love trying new things but I regret to say the service as well as food gets a thumbs down for me.","useful":0,"funny":3,"cool":0}

More often then not when I order something, it comes out wrong. Last week I asked for a Cheesy Gordita Crunch with no spicy ranch, a burrito supreme with no sour cream, the burrito came out right but the Gordita had that awful sauce on it. It took the woman taking my order about 4 minutes to figure out how to put it in, which ok they had a new system so I'll cut them some slack but still. Today I went and ordered a single Double Chalupa, 10 minutes later I went back up and they said \"they're making it now\"...seriously? A one item order and they wait till someone is basically out the door to make it. The best part when I said \"don't worry about making it just give me my money back\" they looked like I just asked them the mathematical formula for calculating the speed of light. I'm happy y'all get $11 bucks an hour now but seriously try to not suck at your job.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Worst apartment complex to lease at. They have very unprofessional people working at the office. The complex is right next to a sketchy trailer park whose residents jump over the wall and steal belongings off the properties. The management does NOTHING to properly secure the area (security, cameras, etc.) The shape and condition of the apartments are crap. You can hear every footstep of the person walking above you. They charge for unnecessary maintenance that is clearly their fault. Very mediocre and old appliances put in.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}
